# Introduction: .sc[iconicity]

Iconicity has been studied in different perspectives since the 1980s:

* iconic ordering of clausal constituents in relation to their temporal order in syntax and pragmatics .ref[(e.g. Haiman 1985; Simone 1995; Radden &amp; Panther 2004)];
* iconic relations between sounds and meaning, viz. phonaesthemes and sound symbolism in phonetics, phonology and morphology .ref[(Hinton, Nichols &amp; Ohala 1994; Perniss &amp; Vigliocco 2014; Lockwood 2017)]; 
* iconicity across different modalities such as in sign language .ref[(Taub 2001)] or metaphor .ref[(Hiraga 2005)]; 
* and in the .sc[lexicon] (.markeer[onomatopoeia] and .markeer[ideophones] or .markeer[mimetics], .ref[cf. Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001; Dingemanse 2012; 2018; Haiman 2018)].
 
.ru-blockquote[This dissertation is about onomatopoeia and ideophones / mimetics.]

# Ideophones: examples

Language | Examples
--- | ---
Korean &lt;br&gt; .ref[(Lee 1992)] | *potïl* ‘soft and tender (surface)’, *palt’ak* ‘palpitating, jerking’, *c’onc’on* ‘woven tightly’, *ulakpulak* ‘unbalanced scary appearance’, *colcol* ‘flowing liquid’, *kalphancilphaN* ‘unable to decide’
Pastaza Quechua &lt;br&gt; .ref[(Nuckolls 1996)] | *dzing* ‘a sudden awareness or intuition, especially one that causes fright’, *sa* ‘expanded or random movement from or within a locus’, *tsung* ‘to absorb, cover, or drench with a liquid substance’, *palay* ‘to fall rapidly and/or peltingly, as a collectivity of entities’
Siwu &lt;br&gt; .ref[(Dingemanse 2011)] | *gùdùù* ‘pitch dark’, *gblogblogblo* ‘bubbling’, *fũɛ̃fũɛ̃* ‘malleable' *kpɔtɔtɔrɔ-kpɔtɔtɔrɔ* ‘walking like a  tortoise’, *ɣììì*  ‘sensation of vertigo’, *wɔ̃rã~wɔ̃rã* ‘spotted, patchy pattern’, *nyɛ̃kɛ̃nyɛ̃kɛ̃* ‘intensely sweet’, *kpiɛkpiɛ* ‘lukewarm’

Examples presented in Dingemanse's .ref[(2012:661)] overview article

# Ideophones: semantic domains

Domain | Example
--- | ---
.sc[sound] | *miāo* 喵 ‘mew, miaow’
.sc[movement] | *yōuyōu* 攸攸 ‘move swiftly, quickly; smoothly slipping by, rapidly rushing’
.sc[visual patterns] | *zhēngróng* 崢嶸 ‘craggy, precipitous masses of rock; loftily lifted; sheer steepness; high-piled’
.sc[other sensory perceptions] | *bìbì* 苾苾 ‘deeply fragrant’
.sc[inner feelings and cognitive states] | *xǔxǔ* 栩栩 ‘glad and gay, happy and light-heared, smug and satisfied’

Hierarchy presented in .ref[Dingemanse (2012:663)].

As it can be seen, .markeer[Chinese has examples for all these different domains].
Yet, it is usually left out from the cross-linguistic debate.

---

# Ideophones: terminology

Japanese-inspired | Cross-linguistic | Reduplication | Examples
--- | --- | ---
擬聲詞 &lt;br&gt; *giongo* 擬音語 &lt;br&gt; .markeer[phonomimes] | .markeer2[ideophones] &lt;br&gt;  onomatopoeia | non-red. or A| 哔 'peep', &lt;br&gt; 咻 'shew' (.sc[sound + visual])
擬態詞 &lt;br&gt; *gitaigo* 擬態語 &lt;br&gt; .markeer[phenomimes] | .markeer2[ideophones] &lt;br&gt; non-phonomimes  | full red. or XAA (ABB) &lt;br&gt; partial red. or AB |  雾-濛濛 'fog-misty' &lt;br&gt; 崢嶸 'precipitous'
擬情詞 &lt;br&gt; *gijōgo* 擬情語 &lt;br&gt; .markeer[psychomimes] | .markeer2[ideophones] &lt;br&gt; non-phonomimes   | full red. or AA | 欣欣 'joyful'

These terms each highlight a different aspect of the data (cf. section 2 of the proposal).

It is my goal to unify these aspects into a single, though multi-faceted theory.

---

# Defining ideophones

Such a theory is already in the making: Dingemanse's .ref[(2011; 2012)] definition:

.ru-blockquote[Ideophones are marked words that depict sensory imagery.]

form | meaning
--- | ---
marked | depiction 
words | sensory imagery

Most studies up to this point have focused on the .sc[form].
When .sc[meaning] is taken into account, the scope usually only contains .sc[sound].

I want to focus mostly on the .sc[meaning] but not without losing .sc[form] out of sight.

Moreover: variation is what interests me.

# Research questions

.Large[.markeer[What does the semantic structure of Chinese ideophones look like?]]

.Large[
.markeer2[
1. Is there any variation at play, and if so, in what ways?
1. How have these structure evolved over time?
1. What constructions do ideophones appear in and what are their functions?
]
]

---

# Main research question

.Large[.markeer[What does the semantic structure of Chinese ideophones look like?]]

This is the main question.

I want to answer this by:

* answering the subquestions
* as a starting point: Dingemanse's definition
* database of ideophones

[I hope to maybe show this briefly during my proposal 口試.]

---

# RQ 1: Variation

.Large[.markeer2[Is there any variation at play, and if so, in what ways?]]

Usually, constructions are defined as mappings between .sc[form] and .sc[meaning] .ref[(Langacker 1987; 1991; 2008)] or .sc[form] and .sc[function] .ref[(Fillmore 1988; Goldberg 1995; 2006; Croft 2001)]

`$$form \mid meaning$$`

Chinese has a folk model of *xíng yīn yì* 形音義 (all culminating in 'the character' *zì* 字, cf. .ref[Packard 1998; 2000])

`$$\frac{sound}{writing} \mid meaning$$`

&lt;!-- Clearly, there can be variation at any of these poles: --&gt;

---

# RQ 1: Variation

.Large[.markeer2[Is there any variation at play, and if so, in what ways?]]


`$$\frac{sound}{writing} \mid meaning$$`

Clearly, there can be variation at any of these poles:

Pole | Example
--- | ---
.sc[sound] vs. .sc[meaning] | /jījīzhāzhā/ referring to the sounds of 'mice' or 'people chattering'
.sc[writing] vs. .sc[meaning] | &lt;嘰嘰喳喳\&gt; referring to the sounds of 'mice' or 'people chattering'
.sc[sound] vs. .sc[writing] | /xīlīhuālā/ being written as 唏哩嘩啦 or 稀裡嘩啦 &lt;br&gt; maybe there is a better example?


---

# RQ 1: Variation

.Large[.markeer2[Is there any variation at play, and if so, in what ways?]]


Ideophones of different modalities, e.g. .sc[sound], .sc[visual], .sc[other perceptions], .sc[inner feelings] and .sc[cognitive states].

Case study of .sc[visual] ideophones, more precisely ideophones in the domain of .sc[light].

Later on another major case study with .sc[auditory] ideophones.

Cursory findings:

* prototypical structure of meanings
* token frequency effects
* type frequency effects

---

# RQ 2: Diachronic evolution

.Large[.markeer2[How have these structure evolved over time?]]

Using the same case study of .sc[light] ideophones:

* the semantic structure is dynamic and evolves over time
* new meanings are formed from certain meanings or clusters of meanings in similar ways for the data under inspection
* these meaning extensions are motivated (yet not predictable)

---

# RQ 3: Qualitative approaches

.Large[.markeer2[What constructions do ideophones appear in and what are their functions?]]

Some possible future lines of development:

* investigating particular constructions, &lt;br&gt; e.g. .sc[v-qilai + ideophone]) with particular theories (e.g. Cognitive Grammar .ref[(Langacker 1987; 1991; 2008)], collostructions .ref[(Stefanowitsch &amp; Gries 2003)]
* multimodality: ideophone and image, &lt;br&gt; cf. comic book studies .ref[(Forceville &amp; Urios-Aparisi 2009)] or clothing terms .ref[(Geeraerts, Grondelaers &amp; Bakema 1994)]
* acquisition: the role of intersubjectivity .ref[(Verhagen 2005)] in this process

---

# Structure and contributions

![](structure.pdf)

A holistic study with attention to balances between:

* synchronic and diachronic
* qualitative and quantitative
* paradigmatic and syntagmatic
* form, meaning, and usage

---

# Methodology

The methodological frameworks in this dissertation draw heavily on approaches from Cognitive semantics, e.g.:

* Diachronic prototype semantics .ref[(Geeraerts 1997)]
* Conceptual Metaphor Theory .ref[(Lakoff &amp; Johnson 1980; Kövecses 2017)]
* Mental Spaces .ref[(Fauconnier &amp; Sweetser 1996; Fauconnier &amp; Turner 2003)]
* Frequency effects .ref[(Bybee &amp; Hopper 2001)]

Combined with computational approaches, such as distributional semantics:

* Cognitive Linguistics .ref[(Heylen, Speelman &amp; Geeraerts 2012; Wielfaert, Heylen &amp; Speelman 2013; Heylen et al. 2015; Peirsman, Geeraerts &amp; Speelman 2015)]
* `word2vec`-like approaches .ref[((Mikolov, Yih &amp; Zweig 2013; Mikolov et al. 2013; (Goldberg &amp; Levy 2014)]
* `R` .ref[(Silge 2017a; 2017b)] and `python`

# Case study: .sc[light] ideophones

![](hierarchy.pdf)

From these ideophones that are expressed by the sensory modality of .sc[vision] &lt;br&gt; be it dynamic (.sc[movement]) or static (.sc[vision]),
&lt;br&gt; I have chosent those that express .sc[light].

Similar to the English *gl-* phonaestheme:

* *glare, gleam, glim, glimmer, glint, glisten, glister, glitter, gloaming, glow*
* *glance, glaze, glimpse, glint*
* *glacé, glacier, glair, glare, glass, glaze, gloss*

# *Huīhuī* 煇煇, *huīhuī* 輝輝,  *huīhuī* 暉暉

Let us take these three as a case study for this presentation:

Mandarin |Middle Chinese|Old Chinese|MOE|Shuowen jiezi
--- |--- |--- |--- 
暉 huī |&lt;MC xjwɨj |&lt;OC *qʷʰər|「 晴朗的樣子。」|「 光也。」
輝 huī |&lt;MC xjwɨj |&lt;OC *qʷʰər||「 光也。」
煇 huī |&lt;MC xjwɨj |&lt;OC *qʷʰər||「 光也。」

Based on the definitions, one could presume that their meanings are entirely the same, i.e. synonymous.

But below I will show that this is not the case.

---

# *Huīhuī* 煇煇, *huīhuī* 輝輝,  *huīhuī* 暉暉

Step 0. .markeer[Getting the data from corpus (manual copying) + 'wrangling' into concordance]

Step 1. .markeer[Identifying the collocate]

*huīhuī* 輝輝 with .markeer2[LIGHT] radical

* "Spring clouds gently drifting, .under[the sun] *blazing*" 春雲澹澹日輝輝, in collection of 御定佩文齋廣群芳譜
* "On a clear morning, .under[the lantern] *burning brightly*" 清晨輝輝燭, in collection of 御定佩文齋廣群芳譜
* "*Bright* .under[cinnabar]" 輝輝丹, in collection of 御定佩文齋廣群芳譜
* "*Bright* is the light, shining in the 5 .under[colours]" 輝輝有光曜五色, in 全後漢文

---

# *Huīhuī* 煇煇, *huīhuī* 輝輝,  *huīhuī* 暉暉

Step 1. .markeer[Identifying the collocate]

*huīhuī* 煇煇 with .markeer2[FIRE] radical

* "[...] make ill .under[the ear], and the sound *blazing*" 病耳聾煇煇, in 耳病門
* ".under[candles] *burning brightly*"燭煇煇, in 咸淳臨安志
* "The colour .under[red] is *flaming brightly*" 赤之色煇煇也, in 易緯稽覽圖

*huīhuī* 暉暉 with .markeer2[SUN] radical

* ".under[vermillion red] and *bright* the drunken face" 暉暉朱顏酡, in 全宋詩
* "*Brightly red*, watching the .under[setting sun]" 暉暉視落日, in 梁詩
* ".under[The sun] *brightly red*, under the mountain" 日暉暉兮山之下, in 全宋詩

---

# *Huīhuī* 煇煇, *huīhuī* 輝輝,  *huīhuī* 暉暉

Step 2. .markeer[Count these collocates per period]

![](huihui.pdf)

---

# *Huīhuī* 煇煇, *huīhuī* 輝輝,  *huīhuī* 暉暉

There is a big type frequency difference: *huīhuī* 輝輝 with .markeer2[LIGHT] radical has a much higher .markeer2[type frequency] in terms of different referential collocates.

Still, they each are similar in meanings, e.g. shades of .sc[red], just different shades per ideophone.

This difference in type frequency inspired an inquiry into .markeer2[token frequency].

---

# *Huīhuī*s vs. *zhuózhuó* 灼灼

![](huihuizhuozhuo.png)

*Zhuózhuó* was much more common than any of the three *huīhuī*s -- in fact, it had the highest .markeer2[token frequency] of all the ideophones under consideration.

---

# *Zhuózhuó* 灼灼

![](zhuozhuo.pdf)

Prototypical bundle of very frequent meanings: .sc[blossoming] frame, with less salient in the margins.

---

# Computational complement

It is useful for future research to be able to try to automate such analysis, in order to gain more insight.

Operationalized: how can computational methods help us better understand the semantic structure of ideophones?

As mentioned, answers were found in .markeer[distributional semantics] methodology.

Step 0. .markeer[Gathering data]

The material stayed the same -- Scripta Sinica corpus 漢籍全文資料庫計畫 -- but I wrote a `python` script (with the `selenium` library) to gather the data, instead of having to manually copy it.

---

# Computational complement

Step 1. .markeer[Segmenting text]

Using the `python` library `jieba`, I segmented the text, which was relatively successful. 

In order to aid in the segmentation process, two 'dictionaries' were added to `jieba`:

1. a list of ideophones (database)
1. a list of particles used in Premodern Chinese .ref[cf. Jonker, Esch &amp; Mansvelt Beck (2011)]

Step 2. .markeer[Choice of model and units]

* word-based (as opposed to syntax-based or text-based)
* skip-grams (cf. [this blog post](https://juliasilge.com/blog/tidy-word-vectors/) and [this one](https://juliasilge.com/blog/word-vectors-take-two/))]
* functions written with `R` (a function called `sliding_windows()`)

---

# Computational complement

Step 3. .markeer[Frequencies and co-occurrence strength]

* calculating the pointwise mutual information PMI for every pair of words, using a function `tidy_pmi()`

Step 4. .markeer[Similarity]

* reducing the dimensionality with singular value decomposition SVD, with a function `widely_svd()` from the `widyr` package

Step 5. .markeer[Interpreting the results]

Now there is a long data frame ('table-like object in `R`'), with a score for each 'neighbour' ('calculated collocate')

---

Step 3: frequencies and co-occurrence strength. Next, the strength of the co-occurrence of the skip-grams that resulted from the previous function needs to be weighted. For this we will also calculate the PMI value for each pair of words. This is then stored in a tidy data frame44 (Wickham 2014). This function is called tidy_pmi() and results in an extremely long and thin table.
Step 4: similarity. To reduce the dimensionality the widely_svd() function from the widyr package is used. In her example, Silge uses 256 dimensions, which seems to be a good number for our data as well. This eventually results in a data frame object tidy_word_vectors, which can be queried for the nearest neighbours of a target word.

conclusion:

Research questions:
What does the semantic structure of Chinese ideophones look like?
a. Is there any variation at play, and if so, in what ways?
b. How have these structure evolved over time?
c. What constructions do ideophones appear in and what are their functions?
