m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540858,u3031,PICARD,And that's exactly what he's going to do.

The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540685,u3031,PICARD,What programs were accessed?
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540684,u3028,GEORDI,It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540951,u3031,PICARD,Please.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540950,u3034,SHINZON,That's your life... not mine.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540947,u3034,SHINZON,I don't know.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540945,u3034,SHINZON,Yes.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540935,u3034,SHINZON,Long ago.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540934,u3031,PICARD,"I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be."

Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540932,u3034,SHINZON,I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540929,u3031,PICARD,And what of the Enterprise?
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540928,u3034,SHINZON,To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540927,u3031,PICARD,Why are you here?
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540926,u3034,SHINZON,"It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540925,u3031,PICARD,We are.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540759,u3034,SHINZON,"I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself."

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540757,u3034,SHINZON,It amazes me how little you know yourself.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540756,u3031,PICARD,"Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?"
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540755,u3034,SHINZON,"Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540754,u3031,PICARD,If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540751,u3034,SHINZON,"I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540750,u3031,PICARD,I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540749,u3034,SHINZON,And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540748,u3031,PICARD,You're not Reman.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540746,u3031,PICARD,What's this all about?
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540745,u3034,SHINZON,Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe I�ll snap its ugly head off.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540742,u3034,SHINZON,"Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540741,u3031,PICARD,All of this so you could capture me?

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540662,u3031,PICARD,Yes.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540661,u3034,SHINZON,Looking up at the stars.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540660,u3031,PICARD,"No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life..."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540659,u3034,SHINZON,Were we always explorers?
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540658,u3031,PICARD,"There's so much, and so much of it is dull..."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540657,u3034,SHINZON,I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540656,u3034,SHINZON,All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540655,u3031,PICARD,And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540654,u3034,SHINZON,Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you�d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540653,u3031,PICARD,I have no reason to.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540652,u3034,SHINZON,You don't trust me.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540649,u3034,SHINZON,For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540648,u3034,SHINZON,"They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540647,u3031,PICARD,How did you end up on Remus?
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540646,u3034,SHINZON,"Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540645,u3031,PICARD,Yes. The eyes have it.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540644,u3034,SHINZON,"A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540643,u3031,PICARD,Not quite. I envy the hair- line.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540639,u3034,SHINZON,"As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540638,u3031,PICARD,What happened?
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540637,u3034,SHINZON,"And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540598,u3034,SHINZON,I know.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540597,u3031,PICARD,You know I need to verify this.

m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540595,u3031,PICARD,"We need to talk, just you and I."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540590,u3031,PICARD,You know I do.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540589,u3034,SHINZON,"No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?"
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540587,u3034,SHINZON,"Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer, raise lighting four levels."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540586,u3031,PICARD,Yes.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540585,u3034,SHINZON,But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540584,u3034,SHINZON,And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540583,u3031,PICARD,Yes.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540582,u3034,SHINZON,"Right now, you�re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?"
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540581,u3034,SHINZON,I have dissolved the Senate.
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540580,u3031,PICARD,And the Senate supports you?
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540579,u3034,SHINZON,"I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540578,u3034,SHINZON,"Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace."
m198,star trek: nemesis,2002,6.40,28682,"['action', 'sci-fi', 'thriller']",L540577,u3031,PICARD,I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
