# Roadmap

What can we do with this knowledge?
What questions are to be explored?

* (historical) phonology
* lexical-semantics
  * conceptualization of space: land-sea axis
  * conceptualization of seasons / time
* focus system
  * neutral aligment
  * order V second or V first
  * different languages
  * nominalization
* some other languages
  * alignment and valence
  * Manchu

# Three groups of Austronesian
## Three groups (Ross 2002)

1. Philippine-type languages 
1. Indonesian-type languages
1. post-Indonesian type languages


![:scale 50%](img/Austronesian-big.jpg)
http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Austronesmap.html

So if you know where the language is located geographically (and it belongs to the Austronesian family), you can make some educated guesses about some features.

# post-Indonesian languages: aloha

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" width=400 theme="dark" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Aloha! Here&#39;s a family tree showing the history behind one Polynesian word, starting from Proto-Polynesian at the top.

# Indonesian-type languages

.pull-left[
* phonological inventory is quite small (like all Austronesian languages)
* analytic language (agglutinative)
* SVO order (tendency)
* voices / focus system: actor, undergoer + extra
* affixes:
    * *di-* patient focus
    * *diper-* causative focus
    * *meng-* agent focus
    * *memper-* causative agent
    * *ter-* agentless action (involuntary, sudden, stative...)
    * *-kan* causative, benefactive
    * *-i* locative
    * *ber-...-an* plural subject
    * *ke-...-an* potential, unintentional
]

.pull-right[
Examples

* *duduk* 'to sit down'
* *men-duduk-kan* 'to sit someone down, give someone a seat, to appoint'
* *men-duduk-i* 'to sit on, to occupy'
* *di-duduk-kan* 'to be given a seat, to be appointed'
* *di-duduk-i* 'to be sat on, to be occupied'
* *ter-duduk* 'to sink down, to come to sit'
* *ke-duduk-an* 'to be situated'

]

# Philippine-type languages

* Taiwan, Philippines, Madagascar...
* analytical (agglutinative)
* VSO tendency
* typically a 4 focus system (or voice system)
    1. agent focus
    1. patient focus
    1. location focus
    1. instrumental / beneficiary focus

| language | agent | patient | location | instrumental
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proto-Austronesian | *M- | *-en | *-an | *Si/Sa-
| Isbukun Bunun | ma- | -un | -an | is/sin-
| Yami | m-/ -om- | -en | -an | i-
| Paiwan | -em- | -en | -an | si-
| Tagalog | mag- / -um- | -in | -an | ipag- | 

So this is very robust, especially the first three.

# The land-sea axis

Many Austronesian languages use a radically different way of expressing direction, mostly due to their being located on islands: the so-called **land-sea axis**.

.font80[
|  | Inland | Seaward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PAN | *daya | *lahud
| Pazeh | daya ‘upstream; east’ | rahut ‘downstream; west’
| Thao | saya ‘uphill, upstream’ | raus ‘downhill, downstream’
| Paiwan | zaya ‘upland, upriver’ | lauz ‘seaward, downriver’
| Yami | rala 'next to the mountain | ralud 'towards the sea'
| Ilokano | dáya ‘east’ | láud ‘west’
| Cebuano | iláya ‘away from coast/town’ | iláwud ‘near coast/town’
| Kelabit | dayəh ‘upstream’ | laʔud ‘downstream’
| Manam | auta ‘landward’ | ilau ‘seaward’
| Lakalai | -ilo ‘landward’ | -lau ‘seaward’
| Pohnpeian | peiloŋ- ‘landward’ | peiei- ‘seaward’
| Hawaiian | mauka ‘landward’ | makai ‘seaward’

# The land-sea axis

.font140[BEST TIP EVER!]

When confronted with a problem, look at the clues they give you. Especially if it's a map.
.font60[-- but you probably already knew this...]

14th ILO (2016) Aralle-Tabulahan

http://www.ioling.org/booklets/iol-2016-indiv-prob.en.pdf
http://www.ioling.org/booklets/iol-2016-indiv-sol.en.pdf

However, also use your common sense: many Austronesian people live in warm climates near the equator, so it doesn't make sense to think of 4 seasons, but just in terms of .sc[warm] and .sc[less warm] or .sc[rain] and .sc[no rain]. 
They will probably have many words for .sc[boat], but not many for .sc[train], since many islands are small. 

On the other hand, don't overthink the clues they give you, but just try to stay alert.

# Alignment and valence / valency

## valence 
.font80[
The valence of a lexical item is its inherent relationality that allows it to govern a particular number of arguments

* `看` = usually 2 participants
* `跑` = usually 1 participants
* `給` = usually 3 participants
]

## alignment

.font80[
Typologically we can see some major roles in clauses

* Participant in a clause with 1 participant = S
* Participant as 'do-er' in clause with 2 participants = A
* Participant as 'done-to' in clause with 2 particpants = O
* Participant as 'the given' in clause with 3 participants = T
* Particpant as 'the receiver' in clause with 3 participants = R

Alignment = the system that organizes these basic roles
]

# Alignment patterns

## Frequent patterns

NOMINATIVE (S/A) vs. ACCUSATIVE (O)

* S = A ≠ O
  * `I run; I see him.`

ABSOLUTIVE (S/O) vs. ERGATIVE (A)

* S = O ≠ A
  * `gizona ettor-i da.` 'the man has arrived.'
  * `mutila-k gizona ikusi du.` 'the boy has seen the man.' 
  <br>(gizona = man, mutila=boy)

NEUTRAL

* S = A = O
  * `男生到了，我看到他`
  
---

# Alignment patterns

## Rare patterns

These patterns are definitely possible, but just very very very rare.

TRIPARTITE

* S ≠ O ≠ A 

DOUBLE OBLIQUE 

* S ≠ O = A

# Complications of alignment

Please reconstruct the alignment system of Warrgamay (Dixon 1981).
Make a table of nominals and the marking they receive.

# Split ergativity

Some languages have more than one system, e.g. NOMINATIVE and ERGATIVE. Should you encounter such a problem, you should try to find the 'split' in the system.

This split is often determined by the semantics of the NP

1 pron > 2 pron > 3 pron > pers. names > human N > animate N > inanimate N

NOM/ACC --------------------------->  <------------------------------------ ERG/ABS


= Silverstein Hierarchy (Silverstein 1976, Tsunoda 1981)

* If an NP in the hierarchy is marked by NOM/ACC alignment, everything higher (more left) will also be NOM/ACC
* If an NP in the hierarchy is marked by ERG/ABS alignment, everything lower (more right) will also be ERG/ABS

# Complication

.font80[
Some languages use the same markers for different purposes.

You are probably familiar with English -s
* *dog-s*
* *eat-s*
* etc.

But let us look at Manchu (Altaic, Gorelova 2002):

* `gele-bu-he` <br> fear-PASS-PART <br> was frightened (by)
* `gele-bu-he` <br> fear-CAU-PART <br> caused to be frightened

Luckily it is not that much of a problem, as particles or other markers will help disambiguate.

* `bi in-de gele-bu-he` <br> I he-**DAT** fear-PASS-PART <br> “I was frightened by him.” 
* `i mim-be gele-bu-he` <br> he I-**ACC** fear-CAUS-PART <br> “He caused me to be frightened.”
