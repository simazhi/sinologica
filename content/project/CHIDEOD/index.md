The Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD) is an open-source dataset, which currently collects 4948 unique onomatopoeia and ideophones (mimetics) of Mandarin, as well as Middle Chinese and Old Chinese. These are analyzed according to a wide range of variables pertaining to the type of data, description, analysis and frequency.
