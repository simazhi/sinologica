<p>I don’t often see poetry books that immediately make me go <em>OMG must have</em> but <a href="https://www.theworldofchinese.com/2021/12/poet-shangyang-fang-on-avoiding-tokenizing-shoeboxes-when-writing-in-english/">this interview</a> with poet Fāng Shāngyáng 方商羊 piqued my interest, especially when I saw he had written a poem called 轰隆隆 <em>is the sound of thunder</em>.</p>
<div id="fang-shangyang" class="section level1">
<h1>Fang Shangyang</h1>
<p>Fang’s debut collection <em>Burying the mountain</em> is available since the end of October of 2021, and a copy of it currently finds itself in my shopping cart, patiently awaiting the moment I decide to pull the trigger and press the button which will send it on its way to me.
So far, I haven’t but the day is definitely drawing closer.</p>
<p>In any case, you can find more about the poet from <a href="https://twitter.com/shangyangfang">his twitter</a> or the collection from <a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/burying-the-mountain-by-shangyang-fang/">the publisher</a>.
Currently, that page features him reading some of his work in a video, which I will embed here first.</p>

<p>While there is something in the way he’s reading poetry that I find slightly off-putting, I can’t help but respect how he appears to be visibly captivated by his own writing.
Admirable.</p>

<h1>Thunder only happens when it’s raining</h1>
<p>However, Fang is maybe not why you’re here!
You’re perhaps wondering why I am writing about him and his work on this blog.
When I saw in the aforementioned interview that he had written a poem entitled 轰隆隆 <em>is the sound of thunder</em>, I knew I had to see what that was all about.
After all, I have a greater-than-average interest in Chinese onomatopoeias and ideophones.
And I also happen to have written about iconicity in meteorological expressions before!</p>
<p>In my paper <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/cose/4/2/article-p230_230.xml">“Does the thunder roll? Mandarin Chinese meteorological expressions and their iconicity”</a> (Van Hoey 2018, doi: 10.1163/23526416-00402003) (<strong><em>Contact me if you want to read a copy but you don’t have access</em></strong>), I talk about the two kinds of motivation that we can observe in weather-related ideophones.</p>
<p><strong>A first kind</strong>, let’s call them <em>colloquial ideophones</em>, are formally marked in their phonology, mostly through different types of reduplication (full and partial).
The way iconicity or sound symbolism works in these words is that when you try to map aspects of the sound on the meaning of the expressions and notice a resemblance.
For instance, the back vowels and nasals /oŋ/ in <em>hōnglónglóng</em> perhaps evoke the rumbling (notice the back vowel and nasal in <em>r<strong>um</strong>bling</em>) of thunder.
Or in ablaut ideophones like <em>xīlī huālā</em> or <em>dīdī dādā</em> you get that alternating “over here (high vowel /i,i/) … over there (low vowel /a,a/)” effect.
Combined with the fricatives of /x/ and /h/, it’s easy to imagine a kind of sluicing rainfall in <em>xīlī huālā</em>.
And then l- reduplication is well-known in Chinese as a marker of continuation.
Compare this to the unaspirated alveolar /d/’s of <em>dīdī dādā</em> that indicate <a href="https://youtu.be/SOKGZb38e5c">drips and drops</a>.</p>
<p>Just so we’re clear, I’m not saying these words are compositional in the way Hamano has argued for Japanese, but conversely that I can see how structural mappings can be identified or imagined.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>hōnglónglóng</em> (轟)隆 隆 ‘sound of thunder’</li>
<li><em>xīlī huālā</em> 唏 哩 嘩 啦 ‘streaming and sluicing, heavy rainfall’</li>
<li><em>dīdī dādā</em> 滴 滴 答 答 ‘lighter rainfall, just beginning or about to end’</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The second kind</strong>, <em>literary ideophones</em> by lack of a better term also typically display formal phonological markedness (full or partial reduplication) and also sometimes some phonesthemic-like elements. However, what sets them apart is that they can rely more on <strong>radical support</strong>.
Radical support is the idea that the graphical form of a (Chinese) word contains a semantic element that is expressed, often repeated, that indicates something about the meaning of that word.
Most people know that onomatopoeia (sound ideophones) in Mandarin often have a 口 MOUTH element, e.g., <em>jījī zhāzhā</em> 嘰嘰喳喳 ‘sound of birds chirping; sound of people chattering’.
But literary ideophones typically have other radicals.
In the examples below WATER 氵 and RAIN ⻗.
They are also typically older and not as in use in spoken language as the colloquial ones; but of course, they often turn up in song lyrics, sung in karaoke bars.
So I wouldn’t flat out say they don’t belong to the contemporary Chinese, just that there is a genre effect.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>línlín</em> 淋淋 ‘streaming and sluicing; dash and splatter’</li>
<li><em>línlí</em> 淋漓 ‘light drizzle’</li>
<li><em>màimù</em> 霢霂 ‘soaked and steeped’</li>
<li><em>fēifēi</em> 霏霏 ‘heavy snowfall or rainfall’</li>
<li><em>pīlì</em> 霹靂 ‘thunderclap, thunderbolt’</li>
</ul>

<h1><em>Hōnglónglóng</em> is the sound of thunder</h1>
<p>Anyways, I can go on and on about these words but it’s now time to turn back to Fang Shangyang and his 轰隆隆 <em>is the sound of thunder</em>.
I will present the poem below, which, in the spirit of fair use and commentary on (please Shangyang Fang or publishing house, I do this out of love and don’t come back to sue me, I hope you sell many copies), I have augmented with pinyin in red so as to show how to pronounce these words and so that you can enjoy the poem to its fullest.</p>
<p>Also, pay attention to what kind of ideophones are used here.
They virtually all belong to the colloquial stratum, which tells you that indeed, we should be reading the poem out loud to make most sense of it.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope the lay-out matches that of the original poem but I can’t be sure.
Just know that it’s supposed to have a few lines per paragraph usually.</p>
<p>Okay, enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>轰隆隆 <span style="color: red;">hōnglōnglōng</span> Is the Sound of Thunder </strong></p>
<p>By Shāngyáng Fāng 方商羊</p>
<p>is the rain stitching a bell jar, or the clock remembering its days<br />
as a clepsydra.扑通 <span style="color: red;">pūtōng</span> is the sound of: man stumbling<br />
＆ 哈哈哈哈 <span style="color: red;">hāhāhāhā</span> is the laughter that chases after<br />
玲玲琅琅 <span style="color: red;">línglíng lángláng</span> is the water sword whacking the 哐当锵锵 <span style="color: red;">kuāngdāng qiāng qiāng</span> jade pendants<br />
of cold rocks. 飒飒瑟瑟 <span style="color: red;">sàsà sèsè</span> is the west wind &amp; 扑扑簌簌 <span style="color: red;">pūpū sùsù</span><br />
is the falling leaves that 萧萧翩翩 <span style="color: red;">xiāoxiāo piānpiān</span> with an autumnmoon</p>
<p>In fact, 簌簌 <span style="color: red;">sùsù</span> is the sound of all soft things falling<br />
The tears 簌簌 <span style="color: red;">sùsù</span> on the face. The snow 簌簌 <span style="color: red;">sùsù</span>.The begonia 簌簌 <span style="color: red;">sùsù</span><br />
on the mahogany bone of a folding fan. 簌簌 <span style="color: red;">sùsù</span> the brushstroke<br />
paints the rice paper into a landscape of black mountains<br />
泠泠淙淙 <span style="color: red;">línglíng cóngcóng</span> the rivers flow where the inked mountain is not depicted<br />
flow in the uncharted whiteness</p>
<p>The bold strings 嘈嘈 <span style="color: red;">cáo cáo</span> like blizzard, the fine strings 切切 <span style="color: red;">qièqiè</span> like murmur一<br />
the melody of a girl playing 琵琶 <span style="color: red;">pípá</span> on the orchid boat<br />
back in the Tang dynasty which we still hear through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Juyi">白居易 Bái Jūyì</a>’s poetry</p>
<p>If the river could speak, would the mountain understand its utterance<br />
The sound of a frog is 呱呱呱 <span style="color: red;">guāguāguā</span>, which is annoying<br />
If you cannot stand the 呱呱呱 <span style="color: red;">guāguāguā</span>, please put the frog into a boiler<br />
The hard part: try not to mourn the frog</p>
<p>The sound of the autumnmoon is 寻寻觅觅 <span style="color: red;">xúnxún mìmì,</span>，冷冷清清 <span style="color: red;">lěnglěng qīngqīng</span><br />
凄凄惨惨戚戚 <span style="color: red;">qīqī cǎncǎn qīqī,</span>，which is also the 点点滴滴 <span style="color: red;">diǎndiǎn dīdī</span> sorrow of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qingzhao">李清照 Lǐ Qīngzhào</a></p>
<p>Because to mourn the frog one must speak in the language of frog<br />
which is to 呱呱呱 <span style="color: red;">guāguāguā</span></p>
<p>咿咿呀呀 <span style="color: red;">yīyī yāyā</span> is a青衣 <span style="color: red;">Qīng Yī</span> singing with 盈盈脉脉 <span style="color: red;">yíngyíng mòmò</span> lips of red beans<br />

式微 <span style="color: red;">shìwēi</span> is the evanescent light of a lantern. Wrong. 式微 <span style="color: red;">shìwēi</span> is the swansdown<br />
evening, a girl calling her beloved: why don’t you come back? Come back</p>
<p>In truth, 式微 <span style="color: red;">shìwēi</span> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Wei_(Tang_dynasty)">王维 Wáng Wéi</a> writing a poem to the shadow of his leaving friend<br />
who promised to come back with a sprig of magnolia to light up the yard<br />
His poem has the sound of clouds spread low on the moving water</p>
<p>The lamplight threads a dim song across the voice of trees<br />
that can only be heard by insects &amp; birds</p>
<p>关关喈喈雍雍嘤嘤嗷嗷萋萋肃肃呖呖 <span style="color: red;">guānguān jiējiē yōngyōng yīngyīng áo’áo qīqī sùsù lìlì</span><br />
are the sounds of birds<br />
薨薨喓喓嘒嘒趯趯啁啾了了 <span style="color: red;">hōnghōng yāoyāo huìhuì tìtì zhōujiū liǎoliǎo</span><br />
are the sounds of insects<br />
噼里啪啦 <span style="color: red;">pīlipālā</span> are the firecrackers bumping into the air<br />
叽里咕噜 <span style="color: red;">jīlīgūlū</span> is a mouse stealing oil &amp; falling from the chair<br />
呦呦 <span style="color: red;">yōuyōu</span> the deer sings.萧萧 <span style="color: red;">xiāoxiāo</span> the horse chases the wind<br />
淅淅沥沥 <span style="color: red;">xīxī lìlì</span> the knuckles of rain knocking windows of a departed train<br />
知了 <span style="color: red;">zhīliǎo</span> : is the cicada chirping its name: 知了知了 <span style="color: red;">zhīliǎo zhīliǎo</span><br />
布谷 <span style="color: red;">bùgǔ</span> is the cuckoo calling itself: 布谷 <span style="color: red;">bùgǔ</span> cuckoo cuckoo 布谷 <span style="color: red;">bùgǔ</span></p>
<p>For us, the petals fall with no sound. For the fire ants, the petals hit<br />
the ground with a sound as loud as thunder, which is 轰隆隆<span style="color: red;"> hōnglōnglōng</span></p>
<p>But what is the ant’s onomatopoeia for the thunder &amp; falling flowers<br />
What is the petal’s onomatopoeia for the wind that brings forth its own<br />
falling<br />
Still, we keep hearing, hearing, hearing the hiss of white, yellow<br />
&amp; blue petals scattered in a bowl bitten by the ants’ bitter teeth</p>
<p>沥 <span style="color: red;">lì</span> 淅沥沥 <span style="color: red;">xīlìlì</span> the rain<br />
轰隆隆 <span style="color: red;">hōnglōnglōng</span> 轰隆隆 <span style="color: red;">hōnglōnglōng</span> 轰隆隆 <span style="color: red;">hōnglōnglōng</span>轰隆隆 <span style="color: red;">hōnglōnglōng</span><br />
the thunder</p>
