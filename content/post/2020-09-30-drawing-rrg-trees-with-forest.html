<p>Just like in a previous update where we looked at glosses, today we are looking at how to draw a specific kind of syntactic tree, namely those of the [Role and Reference Grammar](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_and_reference_grammar#" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_and_reference_grammar#</a>:~:text=Role%20and%20reference%20grammar%20(RRG,and%20Robert%20Van%20Valin%2C%20Jr.&amp;text=In%202012%2C%20Ball%20integrated%20his,breaking%20down%20language%20by%20meaning) type.
A brief overview by Van Valin can be found <a href="acsu.buffalo.edu/~rrgpage/rrg/RRGpaper.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, these are not your standard Chomskyan syntactic trees, but rather a more functional approach, in which there are often three projections with intersecting trees: the operator projection, the constituent projection and the focus structure projection.</p>
<p>Here is Van Valin giving a really short intro:</p>

<h1>Drawing trees in Latex with <code>RRGtrees</code></h1>
<p>What is the best way to describe and draw these trees with Latex (the alternative being something like powerpoint).
Now, in Latex, there exists the package <code>RRGtrees</code> <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/rrgtrees?lang=en">CTAN link here</a>.
It has two dependencies <code>pst-node</code> and <code>pst-tree</code>.
So far looking okay.</p>
<p>However, the package was last changed in 2004 and while <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/408134/trouble-drawing-role-and-reference-grammar-trees-in-latex-using-rrgtrees-package">in 2017 it was still working</a> I just could not get it to work in this year of 2020.</p>

<div id="forest-gump" class="section level1">
<h1><code>forest</code> Gump</h1>
<p>Eventually I just gave up and decided to check out another tree-drawing package, namely <code>forest</code> <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/forest?lang=en">CTAN link</a>.
Luckily, <a href="https://www.crissp.be/people/guido-vanden-wyngaerd/">Guido Vanden Wyngaerd</a> has written a very useful quickstart guide <a href="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/003391">lingbuzz</a> for <code>forest</code> which helped me out tremendously.</p>
<p>Because I didn’t find any RRG-specific forest tutorials, I decided to have a go at it and this is what you’re reading now.
I’m gonna draw three trees and provide the code, for public benefit and possibly my future self.</p>

<h1>Set-up</h1>
<p>If I am writing a Latex document, I would expect my minimal preamble to look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>\documentclass[]{article}
\usepackage[linguistics]{forest}
\usepackage{expex}
\begin{document}</code></pre>
<p>And if I am writing in R markdown, my current standard, I would expect the following minimal YAML-header, i.e., exporting to Latex to pdf:</p>

<p>I don’t know RRG that well, so don’t shoot me if the trees are wrong, but now at least I know how to draw the trees with <code>forest</code>, and so can you!</p>
