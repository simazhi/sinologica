Hi, my name is **Thomas Van Hoey** (IPA:['to:mas van 'hui]). Alternatively, you may find me by my Chinese name ‚Äî **Âè∏È¶¨Êô∫** (*Hanyu pinyin*: Sƒ´m«é Zh√¨).

I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinology" target="_blank">sinologist</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics" target="_blank">linguist</a>, with a PhD in Linguistics (read at the <a href="https://linguistics.ntu.edu.tw" target="_blank">Graduate Institute of Linguistics of National Taiwan University</a>).
My MA degrees in Sinology and Linguistics were obtained at the  <a href="http://www.kuleuven.be/english" target="_blank">University of Leuven</a>.


**My overarching research goal is to understand how people construe meaning through ideophones and iconicity, while balancing cognitive and cultural factors.**
**I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Hong Kong, in the [Language and Development Lab](https://linguistics.hku.hk/ldlhku/), led by [Youngah Do](http://hub.hku.hk/cris/rp/rp02160).**
Our main project, together with Mark Dingemanse and Arthur Lewis Thompson, focuses on the learnability of ideophones from a cross-linguistic perspective while focusing on the artiuculatory and gesticulatory gestures of the ideophonic items.

My PhD dissertation (2020), ["Prototypicality and salience of Chinese ideophones: A cognitive and corpus linguistics approach"](https://www.thomasvanhoey.com/files/DISSERTATION.pdf), supervised by [Lu Chiarung](http://chiarung.blog.ntu.edu.tw), investigates the Chinese ideophonic lexicon through four different methodological lenses: multiple correspondence analysis, diachronic prototype semantics, semantic vector spaces, and collostructional analysis.
A prototypical structuring of the ideophonic lexicon is found throughout the data, which is collected from the corpus as well as the [Chinese Ideophone Database (CHIDEOD)](/projects/chideod/), constructed by Arthur Lewis Thompson (HKU) and myself.
CHIDEOD is freely accessible online in multiple formats, and can be used as a model for the cross-linguistic database that is to be constructed in the first stage of the project.

Finally, should you wish to hire me for an Assistant Professorship, unsollicited vacancies are more than welcome üë®‚ÄçüéìÔ∏è.
