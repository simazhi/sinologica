      <description>Howdy cowboys and cowgirls!
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the trip I went on to UK this summer, which took place after the events chronicled in last time&amp;rsquo;s post &amp;ldquo;Hashtag Travels With Bae&amp;rdquo;. Since I am of a recycling nature, I wanted to reuse that title, hence this one is called &amp;ldquo;Travels with bae in UK&amp;rdquo;. The trip we took was about 10 days long and was a real Journey To the West: we first went to London for a night, then to Oxford, subsequently Bristol with a day trip to Bath, then to Cardiff and then back to London with an excursion to Cambridge.</description>
