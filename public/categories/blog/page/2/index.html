      Time flies! This post will be a short recapitulation of some things that happened after the second semester started and I first went on a trip with my friends from Belgium (read all about it here). As such, I will write a bit about my work as a model (yes, I became somewhat of a model haha); my work in the field with the Bunun people; my work as a host to people who visited me; my work as a visitor myself; and finally, my work as an academic, both in Taiwan as well as in the international community.

      After last update&rsquo;s adventures in Tainan during the winter holidays, a new semester began. With the courses I am taking this semester I will have fulfilled the credit requirement of my study here. It is strange to think that a portion of my journey here will also have ended when this semester is over (although I do not plan to take on quitting taking some courses, but maybe just purely out of interest rather than necessity).

      A New Year After my trip to Japan (read more about it here) and my department&rsquo;s Christmas parties upon my return, and of course upon reaching the end of December, there was the annual New Year&rsquo;s Celebration. It&rsquo;s kind of funny because with this even we really get in a cyclical kind of post. That is to say, I wrote about this last year as well. If you want to see beautiful pictures of the big tower Taipei 101 &lsquo;exploding with fireworks&rsquo;, I strongly suggest you look at my post of last year.

      〜〜Konnichiwa mina san こんにちはみなさん〜〜
After my SEA roundtrip to Phuket and China where I visited some of my friends, I arrived back in Taiwan. I was running in Pudong airport in Shanghai to get my flight because I had to queue for two hours just to get through the security check, but it turned out to be no problem — apparently China occasionally bullies Taiwanese airlines, resulting in a delay of two, three hours.

      Hi folks! So mid-October during my self-imposed Autumn break I first went to Thailand (read about it here). I forgot to tell you the whole story about their recently deceased king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, so I will add that here first. The rest of the post will be concerned with my travels to Mainland China to visit my friend Guillermo in Shanghai and Suzhou.
King Bhumibol Adulyadej This King, who reigned actually as Rama IX from 1946 until 2016 (that&rsquo;s 70 years — we are speaking Queen Elisabeth II terms here, although she is only the 43th place on the list of longest reigning monarchs, Bhumibol is number 17).

      Whoa! Has it been a long time since I last did an update here (and the irony of this sentence is that I wrote it almost two months ago but never got around to finishing this update — that&rsquo;s the whole final quarter of 2016). That one ended with me coming back to Taiwan and how I spent my third first weeks here. Okay, so what happened in the meantime, you may wonder.

      After coming back home from ISACG 9 in Berlin and my cool experience over there, I did something long overdue — visit friends and family. So this post is mostly about that (and about Harry Potter). And in the end we&rsquo;ll make the bridge to the present. So have fun reading this update.
Belgium Back in Belgium After I took the plane back to Brussels (you will find that the letter B will appear often in keywords of this bpost [pun intended — Bpost is the national post service in Belgium]), I first went to my xuemei 學妹 (younger female student of the same study object) Lili and her boyfriend Ewoud&rsquo;s farewell party.

      In this post I talk a bit how the rest of my summer holidays went. In the previous post I showed what I did in the beginning of the summer: go to Leiden in the Netherlands to attend a summer school of Digital Humanities and Chinese Studies. Now we continue the adventure.
Belgium (I) I went back to Belgium after my super crazy adventures in the Netherlands — well, normal crazy adventures.

      Summer is almost over and I know you must have been dying to read an update on this blog! Or maybe not, but you&rsquo;re still reading this, so welcome dear reader. In this update I will mostly talk about my adventures in July, but will do a quick recap of what happened after the previous post, which detailed the lovely experience I had doing fieldwork on Bunun.
End of the semester So the last weeks of the spring semester 2016 were filled with making presentations and writing papers.

      After my previous double update — in case you missed it, here are the links to Brought together 1 and Brought together 2 - go check’m out! — I was visited by two of my best friends. I want to thank both Yoana and Tessa for taking the time to visit me and endure my guiding tour. After they had left, I had to prepare for my fieldwork class. This year Professor Sung Li-May is focusing on Bunun, one of the 15 or so indigenous languages that can be found in Taiwan.
