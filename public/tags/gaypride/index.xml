&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back. And I don&amp;rsquo;t know if to you, the reader, it feels as if I have to say that very often at the start of a blog post, but to me it does. Anyway, no more excuses, but &lt;em&gt;I solemly swear&lt;/em&gt; to write more often here. Where were we at last time? Ah yes, I chronicled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/travels-with-bae-in-uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my trip to the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Go read that if you forgot about it, but be sure to return for the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this update, I first look back at the end of August until the beginning of November. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMqL1iWfku4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get set, ready, go!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;going-back-to-taiwan-august-2017&#34;&gt;Going back to Taiwan - August 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hot in Taiwan last summer. We got back and constantly craved air conditioning and only sporadically went places. I also don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have taken any good pictures, so you will have to scroll on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;start-of-the-semester-september-2017&#34;&gt;Start of the semester - September 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;escapism&#34;&gt;Escapism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stupidparticle.com/english-home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an escape room&lt;/a&gt; AND MANAGED TO ESCAPE! It was very close, but I do recommend this type of experience with friends. Let me know below if you have ever done an escape room and if you would do it again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/38615989042/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20170902_181231&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4570/38615989042_a79be0819d_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; height=&#34;1024&#34; alt=&#34;20170902_181231&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;museism&#34;&gt;Museism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in a while you have to go to an interesting exhibition and now (well, then) was the perfect time to do so. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/art-2/moca-taipei-lgbtq/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Huck magazine&lt;/a&gt; observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia’s first major LGBTQ exhibition is opening this week -
Breaking barriers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit groundbreaking for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Taipei (MOCA Taipei) to organize &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mocataipei.org.tw/index.php/2012-01-12-03-36-46/past-exhibitions/194-exhibition-review-2017/2452-2017-07-07-05-28-08&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an exhibition&lt;/a&gt; devoted entirely to Asian LGTBQ issues and art, entitled &amp;ldquo;Spectrosynthesis&amp;rdquo; 光‧合作用.
Let us first look at this painting which is totally not suggestive at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/38648215351/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171001_164621&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4562/38648215351_9e22428d40_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171001_164621&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at it from a distance and over time, this really means &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. I remember how just over a year ago a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/professors-death-could-see-taiwan-become-first-asian-country-to-allow-same-sex-marriage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;French professor living in Taiwan committed suicide&lt;/a&gt; after losing his partner, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Jacques_Picoux&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;who he had not been allowed to marry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remember, on the upside, how I joined the gay pride parade &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/pride-ride/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and 2016 (but unfortunately had to skip this year&amp;rsquo;s edition). And now, finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Taiwan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in May 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the legislative barriers were finally broken - within two years Taiwan should see its first same-sex marriage.
So, I am happy with this step forward in equality, and decided to throw in some bonus pictures from the exhibition： some stilles from the artfilm &lt;em&gt;Passion&lt;/em&gt; 《激情》, directed Wang Jun-Jieh 王俊傑. The film showed three perspectives of the scenes at once, often the different viewpoints of the two characters and a global vantage point - resulting in a very interesting sensory experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not enough? You can watch the making of below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uz1Kj6WrsYs?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;studyism&#34;&gt;Studyism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester I decided to take three classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R Language and Data Science, or as we came to know it: &lt;em&gt;RLaDS&lt;/em&gt;. This was a very interesting class, and I will comment on it in future posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seminar on Advanced Cognitive Grammar, which was basically our lab meeting with extra interested students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonology. This course was both basic and a bit more advanced, with enough attention to Sound Symbolism, so it was right up my alley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this was a good combination for me. Methodologically, I got the most from the R class (&lt;em&gt;should you not know, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; is a programming language, like e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-things-I-can-do-in-R-that-I-cant-do-in-Excel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;it can do some things very well that other languages cannot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) and I think I am able to speed up my research process significantly with techniques I learnt there.
Related to ideophones, however, I was able to discuss the same phenomenon (namely ideophones expressing LIGHT in Pre-Modern Chinese) from a Cognitive Semantic point of view, and from a phonological point of view. The resulting papers revealed some overlap, as you would expect from a linguistic phenomenon that is driven by iconicity, and are complementary. I think I might even use chunks of it in my &amp;ndash; gasp &amp;ndash; dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;white-nights-and-visitors-october-2017&#34;&gt;White nights and visitors - October 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;warm-october-nights&#34;&gt;Warm October Nights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sung by one of my defining bands, &lt;a href=&#34;http://yellowcardrock.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Yellowcard&lt;/a&gt;, in their song &lt;a href=&#34;http://yellowcardrock.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warm October Nights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there was one night-related event that stood out in this month: &lt;a href=&#34;http://nuitblanche.taipei/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Taipei&amp;rsquo;s annual &lt;em&gt;Nuit Blanche&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although that &amp;lsquo;annual&amp;rsquo; should be taken with a grain of salt, as it&amp;rsquo;s only the second edition. (I missed last year&amp;rsquo;s edition, because I was too busy going to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/thomas-in-thailand/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/shanghai-and-suzhou/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;China.&lt;/a&gt;)
Anyway, my university NTU figured prominently on the route of venues that partook in the event. I decided to go with my &lt;em&gt;xuemei&lt;/em&gt; Hanna and her Korean friend, and after they went home, I just felt the energy and nearly pulled an allnighter, doing research in my department. I know, I know, that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the point, but at that time it just felt right, and it also reminded me of the one time the Faculty of Arts students back in Leuven did a &lt;em&gt;nuit blanche&lt;/em&gt; in the Faculty library. Ah, good times. Anyways, here are pictures of this event.&lt;/p&gt;

So at 5 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; look like zombies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-advice&#34;&gt;Good advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway October my old advisor for my MA in Sinology thesis was in Taipei and we decided to meet up. We spent a lovely, yet rainy afternoon chatting about the past, the current state of affairs and future plans, and it was as inspiring as I seemed to remember. Thank you for everything 范德望老師！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27258583009/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171015_190641&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4594/27258583009_069b90a1de_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171015_190641&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-upbringing&#34;&gt;Good upbringing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, at the end of October and going into November, my mom finally came to Taiwan! You might have seen some pictures on social media, but that&amp;rsquo;s only because we were both so happy to see each other again and wanted to share that with the world. I took her mostly around Taipei, assisted by CJ&amp;rsquo;s mom (and of course CJ himself). So, I think I will limit the account mostly to some of these images.&lt;/p&gt;

One of my favourite spots in Taipei remains Chunky&amp;rsquo;s Mausoleum, and the view you have on this 自由廣場 square.&lt;/p&gt;

CJ&amp;rsquo;s mom took us into the tea fields of Hsinchu. It was an amazing trip, with great tea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pride &amp; Ride</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A long anticipated update of my blog. The last update was published &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/warm-october-nights&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;almost a month ago&lt;/a&gt;. This time you are in for a treat (and a very long post, the way you like it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughtful readers will notice that a major change has taken place - this post is written in English. (There is a minor change as well in the way I upload pictures - but it is in a test phase.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that? As I feel most of my Belgian audience as well as most of my more international audience (those few people around the world who stumble upon my blog) are proficient in English, it would be &amp;lsquo;unfair&amp;rsquo; to exclude the latter from my adventures, should they have any interest into the matter. I hope you, the reader, will agree that this is a good direction for this blog - if so, or if not, you are always welcome to share your thoughts in the comment section below. &lt;strong&gt;I am not talking to you spammer guys.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado, let us get on with the show. The title of this blog is called Pride &amp;amp; Ride. This refers to the two main parts of this piece of writing - the Gay Pride Parade in Taiwan and my bike ride with friends to Fulong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;gay-pride&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gay pride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/22547842724/in/album-72157659114560684/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/710/22547842724_55a6879fc8_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;NO AGE LIMIT&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On the 31st of October 2015 Taiwan held its 13th LGBT Pride Parade (_Taiwan tongzhi youxing _台灣同志遊行). The theme of this parade was &amp;ldquo;NO AGE LIMIT&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;nianling bu shexian&lt;/em&gt; 年齡不設限). I had actually never attended a parade before - of any kind, so I was quite excited to see if flooding the streets en masse really provides a sense of mutual connectedness.This event is huge in Taiwan - sometimes described as the &amp;lsquo;Gay capital of the Far East&amp;rsquo;. I do not know whether this is true, but I can tell there were a lot of people (around 80 000) interested in the event. So much that there were two lines for walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We - because I went with friends - followed the red line. Since it was also Halloween on the same day, there were not only the typical gay pride outfits the (Belgian) news tends to cover, but also some funny scary outfits. My favourite was seeing &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wednesday from the Addams family&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/22548671903/in/album-72157659114560684/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/22548671903_acdaae2d5f_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wednesday&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Another major dress up team seems to be animal based. This is not surprising, given the idea of the &amp;lsquo;Gay zoo&amp;rsquo;, which most prominently harbours bears, but also other &amp;lsquo;animals&amp;rsquo;. As for &amp;lsquo;companions&amp;rsquo;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dog(e)s&lt;/a&gt; seem to do very well.   &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/22781572297/in/album-72157659114560684/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5815/22781572297_6b45681512_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Doge&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to extend it even further, we even got a Pokémon mascotte that is probably familiar to all readers - Pikachu. That yellow skin, those brown and black markings, those red cheeks, that electric current; everybody&amp;rsquo;s favourite pokémon has got it all. ピカピカ！
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/22781568327/in/album-72157659114560684/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/587/22781568327_3331fda7b2_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pikachu&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  All in all, it was a great event. I was happy to see some of my old friends back - maybe it was some sort of serendipity or just coincidental, but at the time I was really glad. You can check all of my pictures if you click on one of the highlighted ones, or on the album that marks the end of the first part of this blog. They are worth looking at.&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/22547205544/in/album-72157659114560684/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5723/22547205544_6cb60480f2_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Power rangers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[flickr_set id=&amp;quot;72157659114560684&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;bike-ride&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bike ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One week later, we - that is my Chinese friend Wang Hao 王浩, my French friend Léo and me - went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulong_Beach&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fulong 福隆 beach&lt;/a&gt; to have a nice bicycle ride next to the beach. Unfortunately, we took the wrong way. So instead of seeing the tourist hotspots we saw empty views. The tourist hotspots supposedly include the Old Caoling Tunnel (_Jiu Caoling suidao _舊草嶺隧道), a 2 km train tunnel built in 1924 through which you can bike and numerous of biking routes - like the one we took, but in the wrong direction. However, we still got some nice views.
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/22879892150/in/album-72157661394505216/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/774/22879892150_906c9aca53_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fulong beach&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By driving in the wrong direction on our rental bikes, we eventually got to a deserted &amp;lsquo;beach&amp;rsquo; (if you could call it that), where we ate our special Fulong lunch boxes. Me and the French guy were pretty happy to find a private beach, but Wang Hao seemed unhappy as it is not where you have to go when visiting. I think this is perhaps a cultural difference - I tend to go to the places that &amp;lsquo;are undiscovered&amp;rsquo; or at least less crowded, while Chinese seem to go to the hotspots, take some pictures and leave. While we were in China (cf. virtually the whole of my blog up until now) this also seemed commonplace.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/23175706765/in/album-72157661394505216/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/569/23175706765_34c08b28d5_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Private beach&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now, on the way back home we had an unfortunate encounter with some really rude people. As it was the first time I experienced real rudeness since I came to Taiwan, I was a bit shocked. The situation was as follows: we were on the slow train - meaning you can use your easycard for public transport to take it, because the train is shaped like a metro carriage. This implies that there is free seating, as long as you can find it. We crossed the train until we arrived in the final carriage and sure enough, we spotted some seats at the tail of the train. Unfortunately, and I was not aware of this, bicycles are human enough to fit into one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fillmore&amp;rsquo;s Frame Semantic theory&lt;/a&gt; that includes frames for the lexeme &amp;lsquo;sit&amp;rsquo;, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frameIndex.xml?frame=Change_posture&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Change_posture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frameIndex.xml?frame=Posture&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Posture&lt;/a&gt;, both of which require a sentient protagonist - in normal words: a human or an animal, but definitely not a bike. I friendly asked the people of the &amp;lsquo;fat people go biking for a day and take up all the space in the train&amp;rsquo; biking club if we maybe could move their bicycles in order to sit down. All I got for a reply was an angry stare and the words: &amp;ldquo;But we already put them there&amp;rdquo;. I will share with you my questionable looking face that I also posted on facebook.   &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/23149603326/in/album-72157661394505216/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/771/23149603326_afb7e0e553_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My bike is a person&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Speaking of facebook, there were a lot of people who supported my frustration (almost 70), but some people commented that there are rude people everywhere around the globe and to think otherwise is a fallacy. I guess that commenter is right, but it still is not nice when it happens. And the worst part is that I did not know if I was &amp;lsquo;allowed&amp;rsquo; as a foreigner to continue the debate with these thick people or I should let it go. My nature seems to be to want to fight, but I saw in my companions&amp;rsquo; eyes that they did not want to fight for their seat, so I backed down as well. I was thinking back to a line i our guidebooks we got in the third year of high school, when we went on a class trip to London. It read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Provoceer geen marginalen! (Do not provoke marginalised people!)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is one of the tenets that I use to find my way in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;other-updates&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other important updates that I want to share with you are the bike ride around the neigbourhood. More specifically, I went bike riding in the water park near my dorm, next to the Xindian creek (Xindian xi 新店溪) and around my campus. Here are some nice pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[flickr_set id=&amp;quot;72157659125106023&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we also went to sing karaoke, one of my favourite hobbies.   &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/22547232484/in/album-72157659114547644/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/22547232484_02de42b917_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20151116_004337&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One of my favourite professor at the University of Leuven retired. Em. prof. dr. Willy Vande Walle was my thesis advisor when I was doing my MA in Sinology. I was a bit sad that I could not attend the celebration. However, I saw a call for videos or messages in some form and decided I should also make one of my own.  I like to think he was very happy with it, given his comment on the youtube video and the retweet - yes he is a very hip emeritus professor. I cannot begin to state how happy and fortunate I am to have being able to enjoy his lectures. I think he is a scholarly example for all of us, one of the reasons he got an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Rising_Sun&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Order of the Rising Sun&lt;/a&gt; award from Japan - having founded the Japanology department at the University of Leuven, while being a great Sinologist as well. I am proud to call myself a student of him - which makes us return to the first theme of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s all folks!&lt;/p&gt;
