&lt;div id=&#34;love-linguistics-in-the-time-of-cholera-coronavirus.&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;del&gt;Love&lt;/del&gt; Linguistics in the time of &lt;del&gt;cholera&lt;/del&gt; coronavirus.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a time where most institutions of most countries (yay Taiwan!) have closed during the Spring semester, the Brazilian Association of Linguistics, a.k.a. ABRALIN (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.abralin.org/site/en/home-page/&#34;&gt;Associação Brasileira de Linguística&lt;/a&gt;), have invited lots of linguists across the world for online lectures that are freely available.
I thought it would be a good idea to document here the ones I have seen, and liked enough to share.
I will categorize them by linguistic subfield and shortly elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;lexical-semantics&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lexical Semantics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All linguistic subfields are equal but some are more equal than others.
Lexical semantics is the most equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;dirk-geeraerts---word-meaning-research-its-scope-and-development&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dirk Geeraerts - Word meaning research, its scope and development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzeD4GIfn9s&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt;
Lexical semantics has changed considerably in the past three decades, not least because of the emergence of Cognitive Semantics.
To put those changes in the right perspective, this talk will describe the main stages in the development of word meaning research in modern linguistics: from historical semantics in the 19th century, over structuralist semantics in the middle of the 20th century, to neostructuralist and cognitive approaches in the late 20th and early 21st century.
This evolution will be described from three perspectives: the theoretical one (what are the conflicting or converging assumptions of the approaches?), a descriptive one (what are the phenomena that word meaning research has focused on?), and a methodological one (is there an evolution in the methods of lexical semantics?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lecture is largely a copy of one of the basic texts that lexical semanticists should read: Geeraerts, Dirk. 2010. Theories of Lexical Semantics.
One of Geeraerts’s greatest hits is the historical overview of different approaches to lexical semantics in the last 150 years or so.
Highly recommended if you’re interested in this, especially because it becomes more interesting towards the end when he incorporates more recent trends that concern methodological choices that can be made when investigating words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last time we did this, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/icons-we-live-by/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I showed you what my PLN looked like about a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. I advise you to read that first before you continue reading below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s update I will lay out how I generally go about the processing of research.
It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of habit I&amp;rsquo;ve been cultivating for a few years now, and it generally does pay off, but it did not come out of nowhere and I might have forgotten some of the sources that influenced me.
Since the basic process hasnt&amp;rsquo; really changed in the last year, I will first display again the picture from last update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018/PLN_2017_research.png&#34; alt=&#34;PLN 2017&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I marked the research process with a purple frame.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s dig into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;finding-research-stuff&#34;&gt;Finding research stuff&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general we can break this first point down into two smaller processes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding the bibliographical records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding the record itself to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-bibliographical-records&#34;&gt;Finding bibliographical records&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually this is the easiest part, because you will find references to what other researchers wrote in a variety of places: &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;articles&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;websites&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lectures&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;by word of mouth&lt;/code&gt; etc.
If this reference is decent enough, you should have the &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;place of publishing (a publishing house or a journal)&lt;/code&gt;.
If not, well, bummer, but you can use some Google, database, or library magic in the hopes of finding the metadata of the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-record-itself&#34;&gt;Finding the record itself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My usual go-to practice is going to &lt;a href=&#34;scholar.google.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very large linked database of existing versions of different articles / chapters (I am going to refer to the thing we are looking for as the &lt;strong&gt;paper&lt;/strong&gt; in the rest of this update).
Now, Google scholar &lt;a href=&#34;http://ideophone.org/some-things-you-need-to-know-about-google-scholar/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;is also not without problems&lt;/a&gt;.
The question remains, however, if your institution has &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; to the paper you are looking for.
Usually that is okay, but for some you may be linked to the publisher, where you have to pay for access to the paper.
One of the more recent big issues in academia is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.veto.be/artikel/monopolieprijzen-van-uitgeverijen-brengen-onderzoekers-en-universiteiten-in-problemen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cry for more open-access&lt;/a&gt;, and we are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/03/economist-explains-23&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;still trying to find a viable model&lt;/a&gt; that does not waste the people&amp;rsquo;s tax money, but still keeps things like peer-review alive.
A really good model hasn&amp;rsquo;t been found yet, but I have the feeling &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/french-say-no-deal-springer-journal-fight-spreads&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;we are getting there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, assuming you do have access to the paper you want, what to do next &amp;mdash; that is the issue at stake in this update.
Let&amp;rsquo;s download the thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-reference-manager&#34;&gt;A reference manager&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think now we come at the heart of this update.
One of the better inventions in the last few years is that of reference managers: software you can put your bibliographical records in, and that help you spit out references in the style you want.
There are a few options out there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; and its alternative &lt;a href=&#34;https://juris-m.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Juris-M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://endnote.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Endnote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bibtex.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bibtex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bibdesk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mendeley.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mendeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these, Zotero and its spin-off Juris-M are my favourites, because they are open source and just do the job I want them to do.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s first quickly look at what Zotero can do for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7FOu94Ah85Y&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about this in a blog post at your own pace, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://ideophone.org/slides-for-a-hands-on-zotero-workshop/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this piece by Mark Dingemanse&lt;/a&gt;, which shows the fundamental usage of the software. I&amp;rsquo;ll show his presentation here as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async class=&#34;speakerdeck-embed&#34; data-id=&#34;2b7d44ceb02d4aa1bb441faf59356819&#34; data-ratio=&#34;1.33333333333333&#34; src=&#34;//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, once you get that down and get the basic usage of a reference manager, it is worth remembering that all of the previously mentioned reference managers get the same basic trick done.
However, I still like the open source (&lt;strong&gt;and thus free&lt;/strong&gt;) Zotero-like software best, because there are some customisations that will improve its usefulness.
Of course, as the noun suggests, these customisations, are, well, custom, and fit my personal style best.
What you do with your references eventually remains your business, although I can only hope that you at least reflect on how to optimize it.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how I customized my Zotero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;customising-the-storage-place-of-files&#34;&gt;Customising the storage place of files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a folder on my desktop called &lt;code&gt;papers&lt;/code&gt; in which I store all my, well, papers.
I suggest you do something similar &amp;mdash; it is &lt;strong&gt;easy to back up&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;easy to find&lt;/strong&gt; and its &lt;strong&gt;contents are easily searchable&lt;/strong&gt;, which is what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;linking-the-data-to-a-file&#34;&gt;Linking the data to a file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Zotero you can link a bibliographical record to a file, in two ways.
Either you reimport the file into Zotero, allowing Zotero to make a copy and store it somewhere in its directory where it is not easy to find.
The other option is to link to the file.
And since we made a folder with all our files, we know exactly where it is and which file we should link to.
Then, as you click, it is super easy to find the paper (still assuming you had access and have a local copy of it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;renaming-the-file-after-metadata&#34;&gt;Renaming the file after metadata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after you linked to the file within Zotero, you can go right click on the file itself (within Zotero), and rename the file after the metadata, i.e. the bibliographical record you imported/wrote/adapted.
This makes finding data even easier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next video basically outlines this approach (although he doesn&amp;rsquo;t store them in a separate location. Listen to me and not to him!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aDvAPLZwCY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;juris-m&#34;&gt;Juris-M&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, actually these days I don&amp;rsquo;t use Zotero itself anymore, but instead tend to use Juris-M.
Why is that?
Juris-M is able to &lt;a href=&#34;https://our.law.nagoya-u.ac.jp/howto/jurism-set-multilingual.webm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;handle multilingual support&lt;/a&gt; in bibliographical records and since I am dealing with Chinese papers and the occasional Japanese one, it is a very handy feature, that many people can&amp;rsquo;t believe hasn&amp;rsquo;t been integrated into Zotero itself yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, all the good things of Zotero still exist in Juris-M:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;magic stick input with ISBN / DOI numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the whole archiving process I briefly outlined above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plug-ins into Word or .odt files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;online sync to your account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/styles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;superlarge repository of citation styles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that is the way to handle files. But now, what do I do after I have gotten the bibliographical record and a soft/hard copy of the paper?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;taking-notes&#34;&gt;Taking notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assuming you are using some kind of note-taking strategy to deal with research.
For classes I tend to have a mix of written notes and digital ones, but for research I pretty much put everything in a digital note-taking programme.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evernote.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; since a few years, because of their (back then) really good free plan &amp;mdash; recently they&amp;rsquo;ve limited the free integration on different devices to a whopping maximum of two.
But if you do want to use if for free, I would suggest computer and phone, because Evernote has a nice phone camera integration, as well as the ever-so-useful webclipper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are alternatives out there, such as MS&amp;rsquo;s  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.onenote.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OneNote&lt;/a&gt; or the more recent hashtag-friendly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bear-writer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; etc.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably most beneficial to just stick with one, and since I settled on Evernote a few years ago, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to stay there.
However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I am completely in love with it: for instance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;its continued lack&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/99861-native-markdown-support/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;markdown integration is very annoying&lt;/a&gt;, because that is a very efficient way of taking notes.
But it must be said, Evernote is a behemoth, and can probably handle virtually all of your note-taking qualms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let us go back to our topic.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say, you have your paper, did all the bibliographical stuff correctly.
Now what?
Use Zotero to make a bibliographical reference and put it in the title of your Evernote note. It&amp;rsquo;s best to make some kind of folder to collect all research notes &amp;mdash; mine is called &lt;code&gt;Annotated Bibliography&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you are gonna want to repeat the same line as the first line of the note itself. This is because sometimes you have to shorten the title a little bit, for instance when it is too long because it is a book chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I always put the date I read it, in the order of year-month-day: &lt;code&gt;Read: YYYYMMDD&lt;/code&gt;. This is because if you later revisite the note, Evernote might update the record to the new date you did some changes on.
So I generally end up with a header that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018/Evernote_header.png&#34; alt=&#34;PLN 2017&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beneath that line (&lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;) I can start my note itself: what I think are important points, or things I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with.
Usually I will also write some judgment right below the &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; information, saying if I liked the paper or not.
The trick is to allow future me to able to recall the big message of the paper without having to plough through it completely again.
However, that also depends on how well you process it the first time.
Luckily, note-taking software usually allows for good searching capabilities, to help you find previous notes, and also relate notes you didn&amp;rsquo;t know where dealing with similar things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the option to tag them, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really make use of this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is basically it, but then quantified over many papers. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember when I exactly started doing it as follows, but I currently have 233 notes in Evernote and apparently 889 items in Zotero.
This reflects my evolution from 2014 or 2015 onwards: going from paper to Zotero to more digital notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this has been useful to you (as it was for me &amp;mdash; spelling out my process and seeing how it evolved from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/icons-we-live-by/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;last year&amp;rsquo;s workflow&lt;/a&gt;).
In the next update of this series (&lt;em&gt;Academic Workflow&lt;/em&gt;) I am going to discuss R and Rmarkdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk a bit about research. I know, I don&amp;rsquo;t often do that on this blog — some of you might even have the impression that this is only a travel blog or something similar, but in fact travel is very peripheral to my life, although I like to flood my social media accounts with nice pictures of said travels whenever possible.
So, this is &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; direction I want to take this blog to.
I hope you will still like it, and if not, at least I will have gotten out of it what I wanted, namely, to describe a bit how my research process generally works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-pln&#34;&gt;The PLN&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to figure that out, I first want to talk about the theory of the &lt;strong&gt;Personal Learning Network&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Personal Learning Environment&lt;/strong&gt;.
As explained by Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A personal learning network is an &lt;em&gt;informal&lt;/em&gt; learning network that consists of the &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; a learner interacts with and derives knowledge from in a personal learning environment.
In a PLN, a person makes a connection with another person with the specific intent that some type of learning will occur because of that connection.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most recent years it pops up more and more in articles that deal with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;educational techonology&lt;/a&gt;.
And I first ran into it when I was secretly browsing the course materials of &amp;lsquo;Encyclopaedia of Japanology&amp;rsquo; taught at the University of Leuven&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:The-parallel-Enc&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:The-parallel-Enc&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, taught by Hans Coppens.
If you want a librarian&amp;rsquo;s view on what a PLN (Personal Learning Network) is or can be, I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/22559676/Personal_Learning_Network_A_powerful_Tool_for_Professional_Development&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Faisal&amp;rsquo;s paper&lt;/a&gt; very useful.
However, for me it can be loosely characaterized as a representation of all the different media you consume (input) and produce (output) in your day-to-day life.
Since our current life is largely dominated by a certain &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; or at least &lt;em&gt;reinforcement&lt;/em&gt; to be interconnected&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:I-know-some-peop&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:I-know-some-peop&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I have decided to use the icons of the apps I use most in my daily life to chart what my PLN looks like.
However, I should say, that before we can dive into the current state of affairs, we must first go back to about a year ago, let us say May 2017.
Get set? Ready? Go!&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Yes-the-careful&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Yes-the-careful&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-pln-anno-may-2017&#34;&gt;My PLN anno May 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018/PLN_2017.png&#34; alt=&#34;PLN 2017&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this picture is a pretty good estimate of what &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; personal learning network looked like about a year ago.
Let us go over this network following the colours of the rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;red-output&#34;&gt;Red: output&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first start with the output part, because I am pretty proud of that.
This workflow has been a few years in the making, but about a year ago, I already had a pretty good flow I felt: for school (university) work, I would typically first access &lt;strong&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;library websites&lt;/strong&gt; or other &lt;strong&gt;databases&lt;/strong&gt;, or more general &lt;strong&gt;books or articles&lt;/strong&gt;.
The records returned I would then store in a reference manager, such as &lt;strong&gt;Zotero&lt;/strong&gt;, and in a note taking app, such as &lt;strong&gt;Evernote&lt;/strong&gt;.
I plan to do an overview of this &amp;ldquo;gathering&amp;rdquo; phase of research in a future blog post, as it is quite crucial to the way I do things — it is pretty customized, but I believe it is a very adoptable approach.
Then, from Evernote (and the preceding books, articles etc.) I would start to write my papers, of course interacting with new data in other &lt;strong&gt;databases&lt;/strong&gt;, or annotation tools such as &lt;strong&gt;Markus&lt;/strong&gt; or corpora such as &lt;strong&gt;Sketch Engine&lt;/strong&gt;.
Then, as a word processor, I would — as I suppose most of my peers would — use &lt;strong&gt;MS Office&lt;/strong&gt; programs such as &lt;strong&gt;Word&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Powerpoint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:My-favourite-dra&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:My-favourite-dra&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Excel&lt;/strong&gt;.
It must be said that by last year Excel has been slowly replaced by open source variants such as &lt;strong&gt;LibreOffice&amp;rsquo;s Calc&lt;/strong&gt;, for the simple reason that the Windows suite tends to use a lot of hidden code that (can) severely mixes up the data when you import it into &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;.
So, for output formats, &lt;strong&gt;posters&lt;/strong&gt; would usually come from Powerpoint; and &lt;strong&gt;documents&lt;/strong&gt; from Word (in &lt;strong&gt;PDF&lt;/strong&gt;) format.
These I would then store locally, in cloud formats such as &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as on a regular back-up hard drive.
Other dissimination includes of course, &lt;strong&gt;book chapters&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;(future)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt; articles, but also such services as &lt;strong&gt;Academia.edu&lt;/strong&gt;.
The status of the last one is still not entirely clear, though: it is for profit, but it also has a very low threshold and the publishers are afraid of it because they see their ginormous profits trimmed down &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;orange-daily-reference&#34;&gt;Orange: daily reference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part is pretty easy, it includes a daily dictionary app for Chinese called &lt;strong&gt;Pleco&lt;/strong&gt;, which is free and the best on the market as far as I know.
&lt;strong&gt;Message to future sponsors: Should you be in the dictionary app business for Chinese, please send me a free sample and I will review it for you.&lt;/strong&gt;
Online, however, I like to consult the &lt;strong&gt;Handian&lt;/strong&gt; 漢典, also known as &lt;strong&gt;zdic.net&lt;/strong&gt;. Similarly, &lt;strong&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt; is probably everybody&amp;rsquo;s go-to site (well, not the Chinese who can always &amp;lsquo;Give &lt;strong&gt;Baidu&lt;/strong&gt; a try&amp;rsquo; 「百度一下」).
I don&amp;rsquo;t think this category needs much explaining, but do let me know if you want to know more about a particular tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;yellow-blog&#34;&gt;Yellow: blog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what you are looking at right now.
I generally use &lt;strong&gt;FlickR&lt;/strong&gt; to store my picture, to embed into a &lt;strong&gt;Wordpress&lt;/strong&gt;-driven website.
In the very beginning of my &amp;lsquo;blog&amp;rsquo;-life, I was at &lt;strong&gt;Blogger&lt;/strong&gt;, but then I moved to Wordpress - still available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://sinologica.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sinologica.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;, should you be in a nostalgic mood and want to read my stories of China (in Dutch).
Later on, I used the Wordpress software to self-host, and now that also has changed (see next post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;green-media-consumption&#34;&gt;Green: media consumption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For music and films, I generally turn towards &lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;, or apps that can help me play media, such as &lt;strong&gt;VLC&lt;/strong&gt;.
In written media, I tend to turn to my RSS feed, using &lt;strong&gt;Feedly&lt;/strong&gt; - just a collection of blogs I think are interesting, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://tuppublog.wordpress.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the one on Akkadian history run&lt;/a&gt; by my Assyriologist friend from Leuven, Céline Debourse.
Other news media I peruse include a Belgian newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;De Morgen&lt;/strong&gt; (although I sometimes follow the rabbit hole to less-reputable &lt;strong&gt;Het Laatste News&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;the latest news&amp;rdquo;).
Then, of course, we cannot deny the &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; aspect of news these days - which I think is where this whole PLN analysis shows its value:
&lt;strong&gt;Reddit&lt;/strong&gt; (for Taiwanese readers: 「非台灣人的PTT」) is an online forum where literally everything can be discussed.
&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Instagram&lt;/strong&gt; are very informative as well, although their fun and thus slightly addictive nature must not be denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;blue-social-media&#34;&gt;Blue: social media&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the previously mentioned social media &amp;lsquo;media channels&amp;rsquo;, there are apps to stay in contact with people at home and friends.
As I am in the position of having to deal with Europe, China and Taiwan, I have become subject to installing three different apps, depending on the dominant one in the region: &lt;strong&gt;Line&lt;/strong&gt; for Taiwan, &lt;strong&gt;WeChat&lt;/strong&gt; for China, and &lt;strong&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/strong&gt; for Europe.
And, as my good friend Guillermo aptly remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ay Tomás, they are all fucking green!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. They are. And I always press on the wrong one&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other apps in this category include the professional network site &lt;strong&gt;LinkedIN&lt;/strong&gt;.
I get a lot of &amp;lsquo;friend&amp;rsquo; requests on this one, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really use it to its fullest potential, although I like to think that is because academia &amp;lsquo;works differently&amp;rsquo;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the future thinks about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, almost lastly, there are the social movie check site &lt;strong&gt;iCheck Movies&lt;/strong&gt; and the social book reading site &lt;strong&gt;Goodreads&lt;/strong&gt;, which I occassionally add the things I read.
Note that I have to read many books for my PhD, and I already catalogue them in Zotero and Evernote, so I don&amp;rsquo;t always update these accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;, where I very sporadically unleash a tweet upon the world.
I hope you catch them when I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;indigo-mail-and-planner&#34;&gt;Indigo: mail and planner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these I am mostly reliant on &lt;strong&gt;Outlook.com&lt;/strong&gt; and such Google products as &lt;strong&gt;Gmail&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/strong&gt; (called Agenda in Dutch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;violet-some-other-apps&#34;&gt;Violet: some other apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For learning words in a language, I like to rely on &lt;strong&gt;Anki&lt;/strong&gt;, since it has helped me &amp;lsquo;cram&amp;rsquo; in the past.
I need &lt;strong&gt;Google Maps&lt;/strong&gt; in my daily life, or I will lose my way and disappear.
And to track my footsteps, I like to use &lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s MiFit&lt;/strong&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about that biodata that China then would acquire of me, but my own curiosity to monitor myself is too great.
Besides, at this point, the data will be given to another party anyhow&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rainbow-putting-it-all-togehter&#34;&gt;Rainbow: putting it all togehter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes, that was the state of affairs about a year ago.
As you can see, there are different &amp;lsquo;categories&amp;rsquo; in my life that are dominated by different apps, and I am sure that for most of my readers, it must be very similar, whether you are a linguistics student or otherwise engaged with the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next update I will go over what has changed, but it mostly concerns the whole research output section.
In the meantime, &lt;strong&gt;I hope you can think a bit about which apps influence you in your daily life.&lt;/strong&gt;
And &lt;strong&gt;I hope that you even chart your PLN, so we can compare!&lt;/strong&gt;
Or &lt;strong&gt;if you have any lifehacks or academic hacks, please do let me know!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace out!
And Happy Easter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:The-parallel-Enc&#34;&gt;The parallel &amp;lsquo;Encyclopaedia of Sinology&amp;rsquo; class I had to take was a bit more traditional in its outlook. In itself this was not a bad thing, but I wished there had been a bit more attention to digital media than there was back then. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:The-parallel-Enc&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:I-know-some-peop&#34;&gt;I know some people actively try to resist this trend, and in some way I respect it, but for me it is not entirely possible. People I am referring to are my dear fellow student Ruei-Liang, who is a hardcore advocate of paper; or one of my favourite writers on the subject of (academic) productivity, &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:I-know-some-peop&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:Yes-the-careful&#34;&gt;Yes, the careful reader will have noticed that this is not the canonical order of these sentences. However, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMqL1iWfku4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Crayon Pop&lt;/a&gt; girls seem not to care. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:Yes-the-careful&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back. And I don&amp;rsquo;t know if to you, the reader, it feels as if I have to say that very often at the start of a blog post, but to me it does. Anyway, no more excuses, but &lt;em&gt;I solemly swear&lt;/em&gt; to write more often here. Where were we at last time? Ah yes, I chronicled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/travels-with-bae-in-uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my trip to the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Go read that if you forgot about it, but be sure to return for the update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this update, I first look back at the end of August until the beginning of November. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMqL1iWfku4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get set, ready, go!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;going-back-to-taiwan-august-2017&#34;&gt;Going back to Taiwan - August 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hot in Taiwan last summer. We got back and constantly craved air conditioning and only sporadically went places. I also don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have taken any good pictures, so you will have to scroll on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;start-of-the-semester-september-2017&#34;&gt;Start of the semester - September 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;escapism&#34;&gt;Escapism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stupidparticle.com/english-home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an escape room&lt;/a&gt; AND MANAGED TO ESCAPE! It was very close, but I do recommend this type of experience with friends. Let me know below if you have ever done an escape room and if you would do it again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/38615989042/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20170902_181231&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4570/38615989042_a79be0819d_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;576&#34; height=&#34;1024&#34; alt=&#34;20170902_181231&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;museism&#34;&gt;Museism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in a while you have to go to an interesting exhibition and now (well, then) was the perfect time to do so. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huckmagazine.com/art-and-culture/art-2/moca-taipei-lgbtq/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Huck magazine&lt;/a&gt; observes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia’s first major LGBTQ exhibition is opening this week -
Breaking barriers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit groundbreaking for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Taipei (MOCA Taipei) to organize &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mocataipei.org.tw/index.php/2012-01-12-03-36-46/past-exhibitions/194-exhibition-review-2017/2452-2017-07-07-05-28-08&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an exhibition&lt;/a&gt; devoted entirely to Asian LGTBQ issues and art, entitled &amp;ldquo;Spectrosynthesis&amp;rdquo; 光‧合作用.
Let us first look at this painting which is totally not suggestive at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/38648215351/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171001_164621&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4562/38648215351_9e22428d40_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171001_164621&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at it from a distance and over time, this really means &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. I remember how just over a year ago a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/28/professors-death-could-see-taiwan-become-first-asian-country-to-allow-same-sex-marriage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;French professor living in Taiwan committed suicide&lt;/a&gt; after losing his partner, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Jacques_Picoux&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;who he had not been allowed to marry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remember, on the upside, how I joined the gay pride parade &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/pride-ride/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and 2016 (but unfortunately had to skip this year&amp;rsquo;s edition). And now, finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Taiwan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in May 2017&lt;/a&gt;, the legislative barriers were finally broken - within two years Taiwan should see its first same-sex marriage.
So, I am happy with this step forward in equality, and decided to throw in some bonus pictures from the exhibition： some stilles from the artfilm &lt;em&gt;Passion&lt;/em&gt; 《激情》, directed Wang Jun-Jieh 王俊傑. The film showed three perspectives of the scenes at once, often the different viewpoints of the two characters and a global vantage point - resulting in a very interesting sensory experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/38648197581/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171001_155320&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4554/38648197581_9e60ab316b_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171001_155320&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not enough? You can watch the making of below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uz1Kj6WrsYs?rel=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;studyism&#34;&gt;Studyism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester I decided to take three classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R Language and Data Science, or as we came to know it: &lt;em&gt;RLaDS&lt;/em&gt;. This was a very interesting class, and I will comment on it in future posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seminar on Advanced Cognitive Grammar, which was basically our lab meeting with extra interested students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phonology. This course was both basic and a bit more advanced, with enough attention to Sound Symbolism, so it was right up my alley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this was a good combination for me. Methodologically, I got the most from the R class (&lt;em&gt;should you not know, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; is a programming language, like e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-things-I-can-do-in-R-that-I-cant-do-in-Excel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;it can do some things very well that other languages cannot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) and I think I am able to speed up my research process significantly with techniques I learnt there.
Related to ideophones, however, I was able to discuss the same phenomenon (namely ideophones expressing LIGHT in Pre-Modern Chinese) from a Cognitive Semantic point of view, and from a phonological point of view. The resulting papers revealed some overlap, as you would expect from a linguistic phenomenon that is driven by iconicity, and are complementary. I think I might even use chunks of it in my &amp;ndash; gasp &amp;ndash; dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;white-nights-and-visitors-october-2017&#34;&gt;White nights and visitors - October 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;warm-october-nights&#34;&gt;Warm October Nights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sung by one of my defining bands, &lt;a href=&#34;http://yellowcardrock.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Yellowcard&lt;/a&gt;, in their song &lt;a href=&#34;http://yellowcardrock.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warm October Nights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there was one night-related event that stood out in this month: &lt;a href=&#34;http://nuitblanche.taipei/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Taipei&amp;rsquo;s annual &lt;em&gt;Nuit Blanche&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although that &amp;lsquo;annual&amp;rsquo; should be taken with a grain of salt, as it&amp;rsquo;s only the second edition. (I missed last year&amp;rsquo;s edition, because I was too busy going to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/thomas-in-thailand/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/shanghai-and-suzhou/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;China.&lt;/a&gt;)
Anyway, my university NTU figured prominently on the route of venues that partook in the event. I decided to go with my &lt;em&gt;xuemei&lt;/em&gt; Hanna and her Korean friend, and after they went home, I just felt the energy and nearly pulled an allnighter, doing research in my department. I know, I know, that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the point, but at that time it just felt right, and it also reminded me of the one time the Faculty of Arts students back in Leuven did a &lt;em&gt;nuit blanche&lt;/em&gt; in the Faculty library. Ah, good times. Anyways, here are pictures of this event.&lt;/p&gt;

So at 5 o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; look like zombies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-advice&#34;&gt;Good advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfway October my old advisor for my MA in Sinology thesis was in Taipei and we decided to meet up. We spent a lovely, yet rainy afternoon chatting about the past, the current state of affairs and future plans, and it was as inspiring as I seemed to remember. Thank you for everything 范德望老師！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27258583009/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171015_190641&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4594/27258583009_069b90a1de_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171015_190641&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;good-upbringing&#34;&gt;Good upbringing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, at the end of October and going into November, my mom finally came to Taiwan! You might have seen some pictures on social media, but that&amp;rsquo;s only because we were both so happy to see each other again and wanted to share that with the world. I took her mostly around Taipei, assisted by CJ&amp;rsquo;s mom (and of course CJ himself). So, I think I will limit the account mostly to some of these images.&lt;/p&gt;

Me and mom at 千島湖&lt;/p&gt;

千島湖 without me and my mom&lt;/p&gt;

Eating dinner with my advisor&lt;/p&gt;

One of my favourite spots in Taipei remains Chunky&amp;rsquo;s Mausoleum, and the view you have on this 自由廣場 square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/38998776722/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171103_111107_HDR&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4645/38998776722_354415ba6b_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171103_111107_HDR&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

My mom&amp;rsquo;s first panda (I think)&lt;/p&gt;

Me and my mom at the gate of NTU. Scenic spot check!&lt;/p&gt;

My mom is so cuddly that even the local Taiwanese children fall asleep on her. His mother did not realize at all though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24170410947/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171106_122516&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4726/24170410947_f8a1373372_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171106_122516&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
天下為公: the Empire is for everyone; but my mom is always there for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27258704789/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171028_153436&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4548/27258704789_a84f133606_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171028_153436&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
CJ&amp;rsquo;s mom took us into the tea fields of Hsinchu. It was an amazing trip, with great tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24170092407/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171028_153204&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4580/24170092407_f5d9fe9174_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171028_153204&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
Those teafields have been there for a long time, basking in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/38319253334/in/album-72157666234252478/&#34; title=&#34;20171028_154546_HDR&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4639/38319253334_c4b48779b1_b.jpg&#34; width=&#34;1024&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; alt=&#34;20171028_154546_HDR&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
But they do make for lush background settings.&lt;/p&gt;

Our first picture together in Taiwan - visiting NTU&amp;rsquo;s campus and Drunken Moon Lake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that picture this update is finished! Next time, we go to Japan! So stay tuned. And stay in school!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time flies! This post will be a short recapitulation of some things that happened after the second semester started and I first went on a trip with my friends from Belgium (read &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; about it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/notorious-b-t-belgians-taiwan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). As such, I will write a bit about my work as a model (yes, I became somewhat of a model haha); my work in the field with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/saikin-hai-bubun-tuta-tu-bunun-i-am-a-bunun&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bunun people&lt;/a&gt;; my work as a host to people who visited me; my work as a visitor myself; and finally, my work as an academic, both in Taiwan as well as in the international community. Well, as a matter of fact, these things do not always feel like work, as you may guess from this blogpost. Here is a Taiwanese moon and campus picture to whet your reading appetite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35770647486/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4237/35770647486_cbfbef7c74_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170609_233509_763&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;wanna-be-on-top&#34;&gt;Wanna be on top?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, first things first, let&amp;rsquo;s not get carried away with this subtitle&amp;rsquo;s reference to the catchphrase of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Next_Top_Model&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Next Top Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, via-via (as everything goes in Chinese culture) I was asked to star — or at least participate — in a small commercial for a touristic app of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tour.ntpc.gov.tw/en-us/Video/List?wnd_id=154&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New Taipei City Travel Bureau&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look, shall we? Take out the popcorn and enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I was contacted again by the director of that campaign to help for another touristy app called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wogogo.com/en/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wogogo&lt;/a&gt;. The app looks solid; if you want to book a tour guide, I would suggest checking it out. Here is a promotional picture, taken together with two dear friends of mine, Vera and Aude:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/34971323074/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4210/34971323074_014afe1d8b_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2017-07-09_11-20-55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s where my modelling career is at. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it will continue but both times I had a fun experience and if it fits in my schedule I might take on some more work like this. Here is some authentic behind the scenes footage of me taking selfies when the other coworkers weren&amp;rsquo;t looking, #exclusive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;bunun-fieldwork&#34;&gt;Bunun Fieldwork&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester I was working again with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunun_language&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bunun&lt;/a&gt; data, a language we had studied in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/saikin-hai-bubun-tuta-tu-bunun-i-am-a-bunun&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fieldwork&lt;/a&gt; last year. This time, the goal is assisting prof. &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~gilntu/Faculty/Li-May_Sung.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sung&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://corpus.linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/index_en.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Corpus of Formosan Languages&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of transcribed and analyzed texts that can teach us a lot about how different languages, in this case the Formosan (Austronesian) languages. Different from last year, however, was that we did not really go in the field, but the field came to us! Every Friday I met with Hanaivaz (watch some of her &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/_Slv7eTzOWs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;videos on youtube&lt;/a&gt;) and played recordings of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pearstories.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pear Stories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Frog-Where-Are-You-Boy/dp/0803728816&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frog Story — Frog where are you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, recorded by my fellow graduate student Eric, who together with another (already graduated student) Aarin, are the main participants of the project on Bunun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811336485/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4283/35811336485_250f32f489_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170616_172531_100&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this &amp;ldquo;totally natural, non-posed, non-filtered picture that was run through instagram&amp;rdquo; you can see Hanaivaz and me doing some work. It is intensive work, and also has an intensive after-work component, but I really like it as well. And I recently learned that I can continue my work starting in September, so I am looking forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-visits-to-taiwan&#34;&gt;Some visits to Taiwan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the category &amp;ldquo;visitors of Taiwan that I had the honour to meet up with&amp;rdquo; we had some fellow students from the summerschool at NTU that I attended in 2014, which first propelled me to apply for the programme I am in. There was the cool Antonio, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/japanese-linguistic-ninjal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;who I went to visit in Japan last year&lt;/a&gt; and who I consider to be my bro.] He brought his sister and his partner and just appeared super randomly in Taiwan. But every time I meet him it&amp;rsquo;s like the summer school was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/34240627780/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4190/34240627780_52715ed0de_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170414_220010&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same statement goes for the wonderful Korean Jiye and the great Singaporean May Tay, not to be confused with the band May Day. Here is a picture of Jiyeah! (but for May I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35812522865/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4233/35812522865_debdb506cc_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jiyeah__Franzi_and_Snow_so_good_to_see_you_gurlzzz_______ntusummerplus2014&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;courses&#34;&gt;Courses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am mostly through with the course part of my PhD. In previous updates I explained how that is a way in which PhDs across the world seem to differ: in Taiwan at least you have to take a certain amount of courses, expressed in study credits, only after which you are eligible to graduate. Of course there are some other requirements to fulfil, but this is the stage I am/was at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811334675/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4263/35811334675_7e2fd3a6ca_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170602_193356_504&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;logical-analysis&#34;&gt;Logical Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took two main courses this semester. The first one was &amp;ldquo;logical analysis of language&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;yuyan de luoji fenxi&lt;/em&gt; 語言的邏輯分析), in which Prof. Hsieh posed the challenge to think about linguistic problems based on small data sets that had been slightly simplified. The course was conducted in relation to the preselections of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s participant of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ioling.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;International Linguistics Olympiad&lt;/a&gt;. In general I think it gave a nice overview of the basic components of linguistic theories, as well as some reflection on the nature of language. There was also some &lt;a href=&#34;http://conlang.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;conlang&lt;/a&gt;-inspired coursework. For instance, here you see me and my group mate Nick having a conversation in a made-up sign language. At the time it was only a few days old so it&amp;rsquo;s more pidginy than creoly in nature, but we managed to communicate. Subtitles provided!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;seminar-of-cognitive-grammar&#34;&gt;Seminar of Cognitive Grammar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second course I took was the Seminar of Advanced Cognitive Grammar, which is our lab meeting as well. This semester we focused on Cognitive Grammar (from Langacker 1987 onwards) and Radical Construction Grammar (from Croft 2001 onwards). I may have found a source of material that will help me to answer one of the questions I have been interested in all along: how did ideophones develop diachronically in Chinese? Without going into too much detail, for this paper I was concerned about the methodology, from a technical perspective. The question most researchers are grappling with (or should be) is the source of their data (I am using historical texts), and how to transform raw material into analyzable and usable data. For the moment, I have devised a float chart that should take my data from raw material to slightly enriched material ready for analaysis. Here&amp;rsquo;s the chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35029500103/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4277/35029500103_f66d93f226_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Schermafbeelding 2017-06-27 om 17.32.23&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the question I asked, related to ideophones, was what patterns would emerge from the data. I noticed an interesting phenomenon of post-ideophone markers, which I will follow up on later. Without explaining it too much here, I just want to show the figures I used for the analysis or the motivated explanation in terms of Cognitive Grammar — mostly because I am proud of them, ha:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;魯道衰&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35670057182/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4205/35670057182_6148efc52d_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Schermafbeelding 2017-06-28 om 09.28.33&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“洙泗之間，殷殷如也”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was also special about this paper is that it was largely written when I was already back at home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;home-and-away&#34;&gt;Home and away&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew home the 24th of June, after the last week of final presentations. As usual we had had the celebratory dinner with Lu &lt;em&gt;laoshi&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s group. It was a very cozy evening after a full(!) day of final term presentations - a marathon as it were – held at my Vietnamese classmate Carol&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/hotnutstw/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vietnamese restaurant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after rushing out of my dorm the next day because of the imminent construction works this summer I flew home on the 24th. I arrived the next day in Amsterdam and travelled home to Belgium, only to leave again after one or two hours. One of my best friends Céline had an engagement party in Bièrghes, located in the Middle-Of-Nowhere-city-stan right below Brussels. So we drove, and drove, and went up the highway and off the highway and up and off and up and off until finally we arrived. Here is a cool picture of me with Céline and other presidents of Eoos, past-present-and-future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811339195/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4257/35811339195_ebc43bb4f8_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170625_184209_453&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The even was a lot of fun. I think Céline and Joes (not pronounced like the plural of &amp;lsquo;Joe&amp;rsquo;, but rather like [yu:s]) really fit together and I wish them a happy marriage together! Here they are showing off their literacy skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811469145/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4215/35811469145_e7e53ac301_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170625_162930&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;globetrotters&#34;&gt;Globetrotters&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that event we went back home, from Bièrghes, located in the Middle-Of-Nowhere-city-stan, all the way to the megapolis that constitutes Loenhout. I had a nice week chilling at home, while also writing the aforementioned paper and some more. We, i.e. me and CJ, also explored a bit the beautiful landscapes of Loenhout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day we went to Antwerp, and visited the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rubenshuis.be/nl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rubenshuis&lt;/a&gt;. Beautiful paintings, the best paintings, painted with big hands, comes from &amp;ldquo;Hand werpen&amp;rdquo; (&amp;lsquo;throw hand&amp;rsquo;), it was the biggest hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also a trip to &amp;lsquo;Hellhole Brussels&amp;rsquo; which was essentially a Belgians in Taiwan reunion. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/notorious-b-t-belgians-taiwan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Click here to read more about my adventures with Cedric, Ruben and Isabelle&lt;/a&gt;. It was fun, though we didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;manil&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811353185/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4253/35811353185_297f4894cf_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170702_011911_574&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course I should mention the Sinology reunion orchestrated by my good friend Lai Man. Thank you for hosting us and the whole gang!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35001189393/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4258/35001189393_5afbb561f9_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170702_181810_369&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;ifg17&#34;&gt;#IFG17&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, to wrap up, I will tell you something about the conference I attended in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. It was called &amp;ldquo;Iconicity Focus Group Workshop&amp;rdquo;, hence the hashtag #IFG17. I presented a poster over there, which talked about the weather in Chinese. Well, it talked about weather-related ideophones and iconicity in the writing system. It was hosted at the Max Planck Institute of Psycholinguistics, coincidentally the only other place I had applied for a PhD a few years back. I am more than happy at the university I am at, and now I was extra more than happy to be able to have a look at the MPI and its surroundings and meet lots of interesting people. It also inspired me in some ways for my research so I consider the conference a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35422614670/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4236/35422614670_d00ebb0e39_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170708_213215_216&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is my picture in front of the poster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;no-regen-in-nijmegen&#34;&gt;No regen in Nijmegen?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then finally, some pictures of the second oldest city of the Netherlands, Nijmegen. We had beautiful weather and also good food, but unfortunately I was not able to enjoy the city for that long, being away at my conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I had to look back in my archive to find a picture I had taken of the rain in Taipei, about a month ago, in order to find a picture to contrast it with the drought and warm weather, even heatwaves we have had here in Belgium and the Netherlands the last few weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s also the final picture of this update, so cherish it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Belgium and Back in Business (Summer in Europe 3)</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;After coming back home from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/berlin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ISACG 9 in Berlin and my cool experience over there&lt;/a&gt;, I did something long overdue — visit friends and family. So this post is mostly about that (and about Harry Potter). And in the end we&amp;rsquo;ll make the bridge to the present. So have fun reading this update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;belgium&#34;&gt;Belgium&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-in-belgium&#34;&gt;Back in Belgium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I took the plane back to Brussels (you will find that the letter B will appear often in keywords of this bpost [pun intended — Bpost is the national post service in Belgium]), I first went to my &lt;em&gt;xuemei&lt;/em&gt; 學妹 (younger female student of the same study object) Lili and her boyfriend Ewoud&amp;rsquo;s farewell party. They are both studying in Beijing and you should be able to follow her adventures &lt;a href=&#34;https://liligoeschina.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; — well, in the future. It was a nice experience because I got to see my old &lt;a href=&#34;http://eoos.be/nl/home/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Eoos&lt;/a&gt; friends again. However, it was also a bit strange. Most of the generation that is going to China this year started out when I was president of that student organization, so in a way they are my little children — I&amp;rsquo;ve seen them develop their Chinese language skills and now they are set free in the Ever Evolving and rapidly Changing China. Spread your wings and leave the nest my little birds [is there a word in English that denotes a little/baby bird, like Dutch &lt;em&gt;kuiken&lt;/em&gt;? If you know this, please comment here or on facebook]!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;beachweekend&#34;&gt;Beachweekend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think there are a lot of pictures from that evening/night out there, but it was nice to stay up until three and experience the old early student life again. And I even got to experience being a teenager again too! In my hometown there is this yearly event — well there are several yearly events like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bloemencorsoloenhout.be/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Flowerparade (Bloemencorso - check this out)&lt;/a&gt;, the bike race (leave Loenhout as fast as possible to avoid hitting drunk people on the 2 main streets), the yearly shooting at the chapel (don&amp;rsquo;t know why they do this but it involves a marching band). Anyway, the event I&amp;rsquo;m talking about is the (in)famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.beachweekend.be/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beachweekend&lt;/a&gt;. I need to explain this a little bit. Imagine, you live in a semi-rural area (in Chinese I could say I&amp;rsquo;m from &lt;em&gt;nongcun&lt;/em&gt; 農村 &amp;lsquo;countryside&amp;rsquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as far removed from civilization as that term would suggest; in Dutch I live in a &lt;em&gt;boerengat&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;farmer&amp;rsquo;s ass&amp;rsquo; [農夫屁股]). So, what teenagers growing up do for fun is hold &amp;lsquo;tent parties&amp;rsquo;, which are, as the name suggest, parties held in tents. The size is usually expressed by how many tentpoles there are; kind of like how Japanese people express the room size by referring how many &lt;em&gt;tatami&lt;/em&gt; 畳 fit in it. If I remember correctly, three tentpoles is already a decent number. These tent parties are usually held weekly or biweekly in a different patch of meadow, and are visited by huge crowds of youngsters. Now, we come to the main point: Beachweekend. Beachweekend is special. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I visited this festival so many times, but it still holds a special place in my heart, so I feel I can talk about it. Imagine a large patch of meadow, usually somewhere in the middle of nowhere-ish. This is covered by sand. A lot of sand. In 2015 about 800 tons of sand. This makes the grass look like a beach. I see you get where the event got its name from, and I bet you can guess how long it lasts, too. Add a few tents with booze, a stage where you can see a computer at work and one or two humans who pretend to be musicians (see also the Belgian festival of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tomorrowland.com/nl/news&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tomorrowland&lt;/a&gt;) and 15,000 people in total and you can build a party right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29065657514/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8441/29065657514_0696dc0b11_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20160806_100736&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;books-base-breaking-bad&#34;&gt;Books, Base, Breaking Bad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for my study progress, I read a lot of books. I discovered this series &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/ill/volumes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Iconicity in Language and Literature&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; and I read almost all of the books. These are a treasure trove of information and especially in the more recent volumes they touch upon East Asian languages. Furthermore, I was also busy with my database thing as shortly mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/leiden&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in this blog update&lt;/a&gt;. I am still planning to do a dedicated update when the project has a bit more progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/61/Breaking_Bad_title_card.png&#34; alt=&#34;enter image description here&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then that I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this tv series was that much of a hype in Belgium as it was in the English speaking world but I did watch 5 seasons (62 episodes) in two weeks. It was a perfect binge watch and I generally don&amp;rsquo;t miss watching/having a tv in Taiwan, but it was just nice to be home and do exactly that. By the way, I really liked the show. Of course, some episodes were a bit &amp;lsquo;more of the same old thing&amp;rsquo; but I get why the actors and the show received all those awards and nominations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;harry-potter&#34;&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the hype game Pokemon Go there was another disturbance in the Force: J.K. Rowling released the script of &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&lt;/em&gt;, a play she supposedly wrote [people are having doubts]. I know there is better fan fiction out there. Here is my short review of the book on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10198764-thomas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my Goodreads account&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29056083-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child---parts-one-and-two&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://d2arxad8u2l0g7.cloudfront.net/books/1470082995m/29056083.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts One and Two (Harry Potter, #8)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29056083-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child---parts-one-and-two&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - Parts One and Two&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1077326.J_K_Rowling&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;J.K. Rowling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1722538002&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;1 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand this is a play, which is good because another book might not have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I was extremely disappointed with the flat story line and especially flat characters like for example (view spoiler)[Ron (hide spoiler)].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely, if Rowling wants to go the fan-fiction direction, she should be able to find better story writers. It lacks the magic of Harry Potter and that is very unfortunate given that this is a HP styled &amp;lsquo;sequel&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, is there anything good left in our precious Potterverse? The answer is yes. In Autumn we can look forward to a new movie, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3183660/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them&lt;/a&gt;, set in America this time. However, there is even better news. There was a Harry Potter exhibition in Brussels and we went there of course. It was really close to Belgium&amp;rsquo;s Eiffel tower – &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomium&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the Atomium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29401258980/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7680/29401258980_78cbb8dcc7_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160818_133800_HDR&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not an easy ride — seriously, how hard can it be to mark the way to your parking spots, or announce that one exit of the highway is closed off (I almost had a second car crash) — but we made it. And I got sorted. The animator who did the sorting ceremony thought I would choose the despicable &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pottermore.com/features/6-reasons-its-okay-if-you-get-sorted-into-slytherin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Slytherin&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch: Zwadderich, Chinese: &lt;em&gt;Shilaizhelin&lt;/em&gt; 史萊哲林) because I was wearing green, but how wrong that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahjewell/reasons-everyone-should-want-to-be-a-hufflepuff?utm_term=.akvOARervd#.ou9gLYGEDZ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hufflepuff&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch: Huffelpuf, Chinese: &lt;em&gt;Hefupafu&lt;/em&gt; 赫夫帕夫) woman was. Instead of the popular choice of children, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pottermore.com/features/5-reasons-gryffindors-need-to-calm-down-a-bit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gryffindor&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/benhenry/ban-gryffindor?utm_term=.kwAZw8Y29A#.ibBQyDOaY5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Griffoendor&lt;/a&gt;, Chinese: &lt;em&gt;Gelaifenduo&lt;/em&gt; 葛來分多), I was chosen [secret: you get to choose yourself] to be in Ravenclaw (Dutch: Ravenklauw, Chinese: &lt;em&gt;Leiwenkelao&lt;/em&gt; 雷文克勞), the best house of course. Testimonials to its greatness can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pottermore.com/features/6-reasons-to-get-excited-if-youre-sorted-into-ravenclaw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pottermore.com/features/5-reasons-you-should-be-best-friends-with-a-ravenclaw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/mattortile/personal-struggles-only-ravenclaws-will-understand?utm_term=.piQ9wLR3Wq#.dxxQ4E7ZJO&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. By the way, I feel the translation of Dutch has been done really well, at least better than for instance the Chinese trans(liter)ation. The Dutch translator really went the extra mile to translate all names with a Dutch speaking target audience in mind while the Chinese just kind of took the easy road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29225480902/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8556/29225480902_fb58f82f7c_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;video-1471528386&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  
&gt; 
&gt; Note to future translators in Chinese should they be reading this: we want sound AND meaning based translations, not that &#34;I can make you a tattoo in Chinese with this conversion chart&#34; Chinese transliteration. Best practices include _kekou kele_ 可口可樂 &#39;Coca Cola &lt; (lit.) tasty and fun&#39;, _naike_ 耐克 &#39;Nike &lt; enduring and persevering&#39;, _baoma_ 寶馬 &#39;BMW &lt; precious horse&#39;. Bad practices are for instance: _kendeji_ 肯德基 &#39;KFC &lt; agree to a virtuous base [or some gibberish like that]&#39; which could have been _kendeji_ 啃得雞 &#39;KFC &lt; nibbling on the chicken that you got [like, literally having an eating verb and chicken its name] or _xili_ 喜力 &#39;Heineken &lt; happiness and strength&#39; for which _huang niao_ 黃尿 &#39;Heineken &lt; yellow pee&#39; would have been a better choice.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29065637194/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8052/29065637194_00fe01be90_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160818_124707&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, after that nice sorting ceremony you are led past the Hogwarts Express to the main exhibition hall. It is filled to the brim with costumes, artifacts and all other wondrous things of the Potterverse. Below (and above I guess) you can see some pictures of the exhibition. At the end, however, they did the mischievous &amp;lsquo;you have to go through the store to exit&amp;rsquo; scam. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound cheap but 40 euros for a plastic wand of middlefinger size is a bit much no? Or 96 euros for a not-so-fitting black Hogwarts school uniform? Still, we felt like we couldn&amp;rsquo;t leave empty handed so we bought some candy (like 10 euros), a Dobby mug because &amp;ldquo;Dobby is a free elf&amp;rdquo; (15 euros) and I also bought a Ravenclaw scarf for, you know, when it gets cold on the tropical island of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;byebye-belgium&#34;&gt;Byebye Belgium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two to three weeks were filled with goodbyes, first and foremost from my paternal grandfather; second and almost foremost from all my friends and family. It all went by so quickly and I want to thank everyone for the nice moments we had. I will miss you again, but then again, I&amp;rsquo;m only half a day away, so please come visit mee too. To use the words of Mr. Mayor, a major character in the children&amp;rsquo;s soap Samson and Gert — a show about a now middle-aged man who has a talking dog, a gay hairdresser, a 40-year old man living with his mother, a Belgian fries vendor and a mayor whose main job is putting miniature planes together while his meddling assistent messes up most tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  
&gt; 
&gt; _Aan allen die gekomen zijn, proficiat! Aan allen die niet gekomen zijn, ook proficiat!_ (Congratulations to those who came! Furthermore, also congratulations to those who didn&#39;t.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure that I will have a chance to meet the ones I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to see this time again in the future. Anyway, here are two goodbye pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29580736662/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8446/29580736662_1556af5390_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160819_220659&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29401273400/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8434/29401273400_896b23a82e_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20160820_134200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this it was time to take the plane back to Taiwan. I was &amp;lsquo;waved out&amp;rsquo; by my dear friend Lai Man and then I just took the plane like it was a busride. Things went so much smoother this time (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/leiden&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;instead of last time when I was travelling for 30 hours&lt;/a&gt;). My phone remembered the internet in Beijing, I managed not to go into China this time but stay inside the airport — should you be travelling through Beijing, they hide the transit gate very well, but know that it is there! And I even got to see this city from above. Bonus points for whoever can tell me which city it is [comment here or on facebook!].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29611093851/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8423/29611093851_c6abbf89a2_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160822_102827&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;back-in-taipei&#34;&gt;Back in Taipei&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;rsquo;ve been back in Taiwan for about a month. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a lot of super exciting adventures, but just, you know, got home to where I live. The first few weeks I had a lot of administrative shizzle to handle, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get the feeling of arriving somewhere new [ &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.buzzfeed.com/apentak720/how-much-of-a-basic-white-girl-are-you-actually-1b817?utm_term=.taqd0kQzRy#.reDLeKGx14&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;basic white girls&lt;/a&gt;, insert #wanderlust here] in the same way I did last year. In fact, even though I was here, I still kind of felt not here. It was a very strange feeling and it made me think of the Dutch author &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Mulisch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Harry Mulisc&lt;/a&gt;h of all authors. We &lt;strong&gt;had to&lt;/strong&gt; read two of his books in high school: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assault&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;De aanslag&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;The Assault&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Het_stenen_bruidsbed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Het stenen bruidsbed&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;The Stone Bridal Bed&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember a lot these books, except that (post-)war literature is not my cup of tea. However, two things will remain with me until my last breath, both from the second book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should anyone (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Mr. Markske, our Dutch language teacher) ever ask you what the colour the whisperings are, the answer is green. Don&amp;rsquo;t make the mistake of answering red, which I thought was a nice symbolic colour for war, but no, it was green, because of the marshlands near the German city of Dresden (apparently).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second anecdote is a bit nicer and consists of a quote that really matched my feelings these first weeks here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;De ziel gaat te paard&#34;, denkt Corinth. (&#34;The soul travels by horse&#34;, Corinth muses.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a really nice expression. Taking the flying machine back to Taiwan really felt like a series of actions devoid of emotions (very unlike last year when I had mixed feelings; I had been given a small book with nice things written by friends that really displays their friendship). My soul didn&amp;rsquo;t catch my plane. Either it got delayed, or it went by boat, horse, bike, maybe on foot. I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But as sad as this may seem, do not despair, ye reader, for it has arrived. I&amp;rsquo;m back in Taipei and back on track. As a concluding image I can show our ever expanding linguistics family picture (which doesn&amp;rsquo;t even feature all of the people affiliated to my department!). You can see that the amount of foreigners has increased dramatically — well, you can see an increase of 100%, but in fact we&amp;rsquo;re skyrocketing here with soaring figures of 600% or so (given a 95% confidence interval). So bring it on this semester! As the Koreans for some obscure reason would say, &amp;lsquo;Fighting!&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;After my previous double update — in case you missed it, here are the links to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/belgie/brought-together-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brought together 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/brought-together-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brought together 2&lt;/a&gt; - go check’m out! — I was visited by two of my best friends. I want to thank both Yoana and Tessa for taking the time to visit me and endure my guiding tour. After they had left, I had to prepare for my fieldwork class. This year &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~gilntu/Faculty/Li-May_Sung.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Professor Sung Li-May&lt;/a&gt; is focusing on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunun_language&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bunun&lt;/a&gt;, one of the 15 or so indigenous languages that can be found in Taiwan. They are &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Austronesian languages&lt;/a&gt;, which means they belong to the same language family as Philippine languages, Indonesian languages and many more. They spread out all the way until Hawaii (yes, Hawaiian is an Austronesian language) and New-Zealand (Maori), so it is very probably the biggest language family or the one that covers the biggest territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Formosan_languages_2008.png&#34; alt=&#34;MAP OF BUNUN&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these languages seem to originate from the island of Taiwan, which is, as you know, the place I am studying. Since this island used to be called Ilha Formosa ‘beautiful island’ by the Portuguese, the subbranch of Austronesian languages that can be found here are known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formosan_languages&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Formosan languages&lt;/a&gt; — this variation is “Taiwan’s gift to the world”. There is ample archeological evidence that supports the move from Taiwan to the Philippines to the West and then to the East (Bellwood 2000; Oppenheimer 2001). And one of the languages that can be found in this group is Bunun in Taiwan. Above is a map of the places where it’s spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is spoken by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunun_people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bunun tribe&lt;/a&gt;, whose massive migration of Bunun started around the turn of the 18th century, i.e. about 300 years ago. The Bunun tribe was originally settled in the midwest of Taiwan, all in Hsinyi county. It dispersed to the south and east. The first subgroup to migrate was Takupulan, which had been resettled to the south of Tsou by the mid-18th century. Then there were two main waves of dispersal: The first to the south and southeast, and the second to the west and southwest, including Isbukun, Takivatan and Takbanuaz subgroups. The latest migration was the northern subgroup, including Takituduh and Takibakha (Li 2004).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are mostly known for two things: one is the coming-of-age Ear-Shooting ceremony, called &lt;em&gt;malahtania&lt;/em&gt;; the other is polyphonic singing &lt;em&gt;pasibutbut&lt;/em&gt;. Here is a video of them singing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27560967736/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7436/27560967736_4c920f9bbc_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160606_123423&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently there are about 50,000 Bununs still alive (De Busser 2011). They are traditionally divided into five dialects: Isbukun, Takivatan (cf. De Busser 2009 — yes, the specialist on this dialect is Belgian), Takbanuaz, Takituduh, and Takibakha. &lt;em&gt;Taki&lt;/em&gt; means ‘from-‘; and the dialect we studied, Isbukun, is also known as Bubukun. It is estimated to mean something like ‘the Bunun people’. And &lt;em&gt;bunun&lt;/em&gt; itself just means ‘human’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this course, because it is still schoolwork, is to add to the database of Formosan languages that is being developed by my institute. For this we had a teacher every week in our class who we could ask questions to. In this way we elicited more and more language data, for a total of 27 hours. And from 2 June until 6 June we went &amp;lsquo;into the field’ as it is known, to gather more data by talking with three very helpful informants. I will now try to give an overview of our trip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27495950152/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7339/27495950152_71b59523c0_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160602_123334(1)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up really early to take the early Highspeed Railway to Zuoying 左營, where we consequently were split in two vans. I must point out that we were about 13 people in total and that the vans were thus very big. We were taken into the mountains. Before I had a lot of expectations and romantized thoughts about the village were bound for, which was called Taoyuan 桃源 (not the one with the airport) in Chinese, or Kavalung in Bunun — “Do they live in normal houses? Is there electricity? Is there internet? Is there water? Do they live in tents? …” What I found was just a normal village in the country/mountainside. They are very modernized, but from what I gathered they still care about their heritage as hunters. So we got to know our informants and started working: asking novel sentences (or reaffirming old ones) in orde to explore the different uses of different bits and pieces of the language. We worked for about three hours per session, a rhythm that would repeat itself in the next few days with about two sessions every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27561058366/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7633/27561058366_f9e14d2590_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160602_142318&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in a few rooms above/behind a church. It is very obvious that the Bunun people we met are a closely knitted community with a lot of adherents of Christianity (there seem to be both Presbyterian and Catholic variants in Kavalung). There were three big rooms and one smaller and eventually I slept in the same room as the teacher because that way I had more space. The last day we were joined by girls who had fled their room because of cockroach problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27318061980/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7340/27318061980_3b6ace82e5_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160606_123405&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up around 7 AM (actually a bit before because my classmates are very active in the morning), we went to a breakfast place which enticed us to become regulars in the few days we were there. Things that happened on this included a confirmation that living in the mountains offers ever-changing beautiful landscapes, so that is what you will get a lot of pictures of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27318099060/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7501/27318099060_d205e06ac1_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160605_083342&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27318104110/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7536/27318104110_9c27031535_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160605_080210&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27318119820/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7564/27318119820_63181229b8_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160605_080159&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also attracted a crowd of young fans who kept calling me ‘america’. They asked me if I came from the US (&lt;em&gt;Meiguo&lt;/em&gt; 美國), England (&lt;em&gt;Yingguo&lt;/em&gt; 英國), or ‘Abroad’ (&lt;em&gt;Waiguo&lt;/em&gt; 外國). The structure of these words in Chinese makes it seem as if ‘Abroad’ really is a country. When I asked to show it on the local map that hang there, she just pointed at a part that wasn’t highlighted — not even leaving the South of Taiwan. It was very innocent but also very funny. I may have been the first &lt;em&gt;danghashulbu&lt;/em&gt; ‘red-hair &amp;gt; foreigner’ that they have every seen in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27581569776/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7747/27581569776_b6d6ebc219_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;13391498_1090585777667231_1284373761909731034_o&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-3&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daily rhythm continued, and our materials kept growing. However, on this day there was a unique event in the village: a wedding! In these pictures below must be a significant amount of remaining Bununs. Notice the guy who poses for my picture in the second pic below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27318128780/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7295/27318128780_a34e90125e_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160604_123258&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/26986329943/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7379/26986329943_2357a553a7_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160604_123316&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-4&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next day we had a field trip in the area. We got to see a family member of the Bunun leader &lt;a href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%8B%89%E8%8D%B7%C2%B7%E9%98%BF%E9%9B%B7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lāhè āléi 拉荷·阿雷 (1869-1941)&lt;/a&gt; who opposed the Japanese occupation of their Bunun territories. And we got the whole story of how this happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was also the spot where I &amp;lsquo;married&amp;rsquo; three women at once, an inside joke that followed from my story of how my fortune was told to my by a crone in the Eslite bookstore #truestory. I was going to mary three women in my life, move back to America and would do a host of other improbable things. Here is the picture of the proposal and the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-5&#34;&gt;Day 5&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good things come to an end. So too our stay with the Bunun. As if the mountain god didn&amp;rsquo;t want to see us leave it started raining so hard, we had to stay just a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27495833652/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7336/27495833652_455f69a75a_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160606_134034&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our time there came to and end and I know I will definitely go back to visit them, especially our dear Yan laoshi, or Hanaivaz in Bunun, who is one of the kindest people I have ever met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27581568936/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7440/27581568936_b80c9bd3d6_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;13335791_1088362691235229_6733973097295434467_n&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;returning-to-taipei&#34;&gt;Returning to Taipei&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27595082325/in/album-72157670400401671/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7439/27595082325_4cb8ab1324_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160605_170742&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having returned to Taipei, we had to give a presentation on the linguistic topic we were working on in Bunun. In my case, that was nominalization and relativization. And eventually we had to turn that into a term paper, which I made accessible here (I&amp;rsquo;m welcoming comments!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&gt; [Paper on _Relativization and Nominalization in Isbukun Bunun_](https://www.academia.edu/26868670/Relativization_and_Nominalization_in_Isbukun_Bunun)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was wonderful and I really recommend this class to everyone who wants to analyze a new language they have no experience with — a chance that is nearly impossible to get in Belgium in the setting we had it here. Here is a final picture of the group on the mountainside, with the clouds hanging lower because of recent rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of my PhD is to describe the development of Chinese ideophones from three perspectives: form, meaning, and use. This is a rather vague and big research topic, which is why I divide my work in sub projects, that eventually should glide into one coherent whole.&lt;/p&gt;
