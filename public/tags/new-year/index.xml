&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-new-year&#34;&gt;A New Year&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my trip to Japan (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/japanese-linguistic-ninjal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;read more about it here&lt;/a&gt;) and my department&amp;rsquo;s Christmas parties upon my return, and of course upon reaching the end of December, there was the annual New Year&amp;rsquo;s Celebration. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of funny because with this even we really get in a cyclical kind of post. That is to say, I wrote about this last year as well. If you want to see beautiful pictures of the big tower Taipei 101 &amp;lsquo;exploding with fireworks&amp;rsquo;, I strongly suggest you look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/holiday-celebrate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my post of last year&lt;/a&gt;. This year I spent New Year in a more private setting, far away from the tower. However, I did take a ride on the ferris wheel (note: Dutch &lt;em&gt;reuzenrad&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;giant-s-wheel&amp;rsquo;) and I had the best macaroni and cheese ever made in Taiwan. A very traditional New Year&amp;rsquo;s celebration indeed. Here is a summarizing picture. As you can see, the Taipei 101 fireworks from the outskirts of Taipei has an air of nuclear explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32560525141/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/373/32560525141_4729f7bc47_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170101_005632_430&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;españa-por-favor&#34;&gt;España por favor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as you may have expected, this post is not only about New Year. Rather, it is about how I spent January and February 2017. Since the autumn semester here in Taiwan ends mid-January, I had about two weeks of final presentations and final papers that kept me up in the first fortnight of the new year. Well that was fun! Especially because near the end of that period I got a visit from my eSpanish amigo Guillermo. Now you may remember that I went to visit him &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/shanghai-and-suzhou&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;during his exchange in Shanghai, last October&lt;/a&gt;. This was the return match. We went to all his favourite places he wanted to go to or that he used to frequent when he was studying here last year. This mostly comes down to having breakfast in a traditional Taiwanese place where they have stuff like &lt;em&gt;doujiang&lt;/em&gt; 豆漿 &amp;lsquo;soy milky things&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32566534935/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/453/32566534935_b3c756f081_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170106_105157_HDR&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also went to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tfam.museum/index.aspx?ddlLang=en-us&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Taipei Fine Arts museum&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/artsy-fartsy-afternoons&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;) where there were some crazy exhibitions, in particular this Korean black-and-white movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32566536465/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/370/32566536465_288c2d37b2_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170107_125932&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31722476124/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/661/31722476124_4e24947dc6_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170107_125937&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we went to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Revolutionary_Martyrs%27_Shrine&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Martyr&amp;rsquo;s Shrine 命忠烈祠&lt;/a&gt;, a place where they honour the soldiers that fell defending the republic. It looks a lot like Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall, especially with the young soldiers performing their military service with a kind of acrobatic change of guard every hour or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31754623773/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/663/31754623773_697fe21f2c_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170107_163700&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32566545975/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/295/32566545975_81224e7e63_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170107_164026&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31754621663/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/363/31754621663_df4e87cc4b_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170107_164728&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day Guillermo was leaving he took me to a museum he had been going to and whose existence I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really aware of: the &lt;a href=&#34;http://museum.sinica.edu.tw/index.php?lang=en-us&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Museum of the History and Philology of Academia Sinica 中研院歷史文物陳列館&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia_Sinica&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Academia Sinica&lt;/a&gt; 中研院 is a national academy of Taiwan that is quite famous for its research in hard sciences like physics, mathematics etc., but also bio-sciences and humanities, especially in the realms of archeology cum sinology. One of the most famous presidents of the institution (also the first?) was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Shih&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hu Shi 胡適&lt;/a&gt;, an ex-president of Peking University in China and a nominee of the Nobel Prize of Literature in 1939. During my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Sinology in Leuven we had to read some his writings, especially about his reinterpretation of Chinese philosophy, which definitely is considered as a standard work in the that field. Fond memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what I really wanted to see in the museum were the oracle bones. As you may know, or not, Chinese characters were first written on the belly of turtle shells after the backside had been used in a divination ritual: shamans/priests would take a question from a consulter, carve the question on the turtle shell, throw it in the fire, wait until they heard the cracking and then interpret these patterns as either a positive, negative or undecided answer. They would write down the answer on said turtle shell and may ask the question again if it was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important (like: am I going to get a son, finally, or a 17th daughter? This is exaggerated, but apparently these were real issues for the ancient Chinese nobility). The most interesting for me, however, is that they called this divination ritual &lt;em&gt;bu&lt;/em&gt; 「卜」. Now, you may see that the character 卜 itself looks like cracks of the turtle shell (correct), but what comes with that is the pronunciation of Mandarin &lt;em&gt;bù&lt;/em&gt;, which used to be more something like &lt;em&gt;pok&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;puk&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, this is a SOUND ideophone (onomatopaeic) word that depicts the sound of cracking of the turtle shell. Neat. Here are oracle bones on turtle shells and also on deer antlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32525547186/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/738/32525547186_23e51500f7_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170111_112231&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31754697623/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/331/31754697623_480311f589_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170114_140301_658&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other worthwhile stuff in the museum is the Manchu (and other Qing dynasty) scripts that were taken to Taiwan in the 1940s. &lt;strong&gt;There is actually much more to see in this museum and I cannot recommend it enough.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32566557175/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/475/32566557175_dd7263f834_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170111_104136&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31754636783/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/295/31754636783_76f8b25f11_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170111_103544&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;belgian-beijing-ers&#34;&gt;Belgian Beijing&amp;rsquo;ers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit later I got a visit from my friends Lili and Ewoud who are both studying in Beijing. Here we are near Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall and the two of them jumping in the Confucius temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32525554326/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/713/32525554326_8fef1411ce_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170120_143943&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32443966831/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/613/32443966831_b782eb8d3b_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170120_164847&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other fun moments I had were going to karaoke (KTV) with my department mates, and I can&amp;rsquo;t not show this picture that shows my dear PhD colleague Chester in full karaoke passion. This is how any good performance should be (and I mean that in all earnestness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32443962961/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/397/32443962961_ffea6fa379_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170117_203303&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here are three more pictures of me: reading a book written in blood (I forgot where); earthbending in the museum in Keelung where I went with my Japanese friend Saito, his wife and my Keelung Klassmate Mergen; and posing in front of some Chinese art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32444021631/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/713/32444021631_f00c3a8cc4_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170107_155812_806&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-tainan-family&#34;&gt;My Tainan family&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most memorable trips during this winter break was my trip to my Tainanese 台南 classmates. Ask any person from Tainan and they will tell you that Tainan is &lt;em&gt;the real capital of Taiwan&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;the real Taiwan&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;life passes slower&lt;/em&gt;, especially in comparison to the &amp;lsquo;City of Dragons&amp;rsquo;, a.k.a. Taipei. And thus I found myself with Taipeiese classmate April boarding the HSR on a Saturday morning in February. We were greeted by Taco, Hanna, Nick and Craig in Taipei. I had an amazing trip. I had been to Tainan before, in the summer of 2014, but these visits are always better if you have a guide, and I had four. What I wanted to visit (again) was the Confucius temple, so that&amp;rsquo;s where they took us first. Of course we jumped there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32446494633/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/654/32446494633_3494bd5849_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170204_125913_HDR&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/33105058342/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3825/33105058342_c4c8ccd130_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170204_125812&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in the back there is this massive rendition of the opening paragraph of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Learning&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great Learning&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Daxue&lt;/em&gt; 大學)&lt;/a&gt;, one of the four books canonized in the Chinese intellectual tradition. This opening paragraph was one of the things we had to learn by heart in the second year for Classical Chinese and it&amp;rsquo;s buried pretty deep in mine, up to the point I can still recite it and used part of it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/scholarships&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in my acceptance speech of my scholarship last year&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a swag picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32446492283/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2907/32446492283_63808646fa_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170204_125208&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also for that same course we had to make a diagram or schema that summarized the key concepts of that text. I decided to go for a Chinese landscape inspired diagram, infused with the Taipei 101 and the Chinese pavilion used in the World Exhibition in Shanghai. Should you want to know more, just ask :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/33737439142/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3954/33737439142_3a5ccc43ac_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;VanHoeyfull&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things we saw in Tainan were the Koxinga-related temple and an exhibition on Taoism next to it. God I love these Taoist diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/33105087092/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2860/33105087092_8b6b9e75ce_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170204_150631&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/33261047675/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3821/33261047675_874a3920fa_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170204_143121&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/33261053395/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3747/33261053395_3a8a4e0180_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170204_143450&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, things I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen last time (because I did not know where they were) were &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Zeelandia_%28Taiwan%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fort Zeelandia&lt;/a&gt; (Anping gu bao 安平古堡), a Dutch fortress built with a mortar consisting of a mixture of sugar, sand, ground seashells and glutinous rice. Those Hollanders really can use anything to build. No windmills in Tainan though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to it is a small museum for a famous calligrapher. We displayed our water calligraphy skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/33079656643/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2838/33079656643_bec78027f4_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;16523634_1076188455860487_950861653_o&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a bit further is the Anping Treehouse, a complex of walls (previously with roofs?) that is overrun by roots of trees. A supercool place. I will use pictures to express my sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/33261060355/in/album-72157682212003746/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3841/33261060355_dcbe59807c_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170204_161112&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to wrap up this post, I should mention we went to the Museum of Literature, where they have a book of our department&amp;rsquo;s professor Chiang 江: &lt;em&gt;Nanren de rutou&lt;/em&gt; 男人的乳頭 &amp;ldquo;The Nipples of Men&amp;rdquo;. Must be an interesting read. Here is what the museum looks like from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, two family pictures I took with my super warm Taiwanese family (except for two daughters who left for Taipei a bit earlier). Thank you guys for the great trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now can someone please help me get out of this tree?&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/post/holiday-celebrate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I would like to start this post with a video of a recent earwurm: Madonna&amp;rsquo;s Holiday. It has been stuck in my head so much that it made it to title of this post. The video below features her dancing in the worst possible manner. So enjoy it, and then read the real content of this update: how I celebrated Christmas, New Year and the end of the term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/scholarships&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;explained in the last update&lt;/a&gt;, the end of the semester is quite busy here in Taiwan. There is no official Christmas holiday here, let alone a Boxing Day (which in my home country is known as Second Christmas Day, but counts as an official holiday just as much). So, even though there are Christmas trees and markets galore, I had a lighter &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/suzhou/de-periode-van-de-jaarwisseling-kerstmis-en-nieuwjaar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Christmas than in China in 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christmas Eve I spent with my French friend Léo and our mutual Chinese friend Qi. We ate pizza after roaming the streets for more than an hour looking for a place that wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully booked. It was delicious, just as Chinese natives tend to ask as a standard question for _hao chi ma_  好吃嗎? “Does it taste good?&amp;ldquo;. It probably stems from a textbook translation, but delicious is a BIG WORD in English (or in Dutch &lt;em&gt;delicieus&lt;/em&gt; or French _délicieux _for that matter). However, we had a good laugh and a good evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Day I first went to my class of Corpus Linguistics, where the sympathetic Hsieh laoshi told us that the class would be over after the presentation of our classmate. Thank you! However, I still had the afternoon class, so it was not a &amp;lsquo;real holiday&amp;rsquo;. Later that night we ate&amp;hellip; PITA, because what screams more the word Christmas than a Middle-Eastern dish I loved eating (though not excessively) in Leuven? After that we went to a bar. We, that is me, the French guy, the Chinese guy and a few Malaysian people who I&amp;rsquo;ve come to like a lot. I was really happy with the bar, because they were serving Belgian beer. Here are two pictures of me posing with beers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24720315351/in/album-72157663721058470/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1712/24720315351_651f8ff84a_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2015-12-25 22.44.12&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24813861875/in/album-72157663721058470/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1583/24813861875_afefb5f108_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2015-12-06 19.00.12&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that was not the only Christmassy thing that we did! My department also organized a Christmas party. It was a really nice show with performances by groups of students, a gift-exchange-game and a nice plate of pasta. Yes, yes, the Christmas spirit was strong in the food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24518363860/in/album-72157663721058470/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1652/24518363860_d2b8cd5389_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2015-12-14 21.17.59&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave, me, Lu laoshi and CK - our lab&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24518360560/in/album-72157663721058470/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1494/24518360560_2d154b3ef8_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2015-12-14 21.00.43&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The master students singing &amp;ldquo;You raise me up&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24446235849/in/album-72157663721058470/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1601/24446235849_90f8f23827_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2015-12-14 21.19.12&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Me and Su laoshi While we are the theme of Christmas food - here is a picture of me eating a hamburger :D It was a bit of an overkill, all this fastish food, but I want to assure you that most of my diet consists of rice, meat and vegetables. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24814268865/in/album-72157663721058470/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1697/24814268865_29eb8ed582_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2015-12-28 19.43.38&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I also had a nice evening with my Catalonian (not Spanish :p ) friend Nacho and a few of his friends, as well as a visit from Brigitte, Katrin&amp;rsquo;s friend (see almost &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt; my posts of my time in China). I am subsequently at a pool table and the main gate of my university:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24720392101/in/album-72157663721058470/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1575/24720392101_4634983827_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2015-12-13 21.29.29&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24186083274/in/album-72157663721058470/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1547/24186083274_f4db238dc0_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2015-12-30 18.31.02&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, time for New Year! I was invited by my classmate Dave (cf. supra) to spend the evening with him and his friends. We ate Malaysian food, because what screams more New Year than Malaysian food? :D Then we went to Taipei 101, which is sometimes referred to as (Taipei) 202 in a running joke among the locals. What will follow now is a series of pictures of the fireworks - by far the most impressive fireworks I have ever seen, because they launch them from 202. Just a shame that it only lasted for about 1.5 minutes*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24788003746/in/album-72157664241091486/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1708/24788003746_c86d620b4d_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2015-12-31 19.58.08&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24187418033/in/album-72157664241091486/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1699/24187418033_e9145d0fa4_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;uonTa&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;As you can see (you can see more by clicking left and right on the pictures), it was beautiful! It was also very crowded - a phenomenon that is called &lt;em&gt;ren shan ren hai&lt;/em&gt; 人山人海 &amp;lsquo;people mountain people sea&amp;rsquo; in Chinese. After the fireworks show some people left, but most seemed to stay for a New Year performance by A-Mei 張惠妹. I was not particularly familiar with her songs, but I really liked the concert. I was joking that she should sing a song by Jay Chou 周杰倫, my favourite singer and she did （at around 25:45), as well as May Day 五月天 (at 57:00):  So I was watching the concert with my friends, and I had one of the most wonderful New Year Eves ever. Even though I am far from home, I still kind of felt at my place and I really want to thank my friends for that. That is why I put up the following pics of them (I don&amp;rsquo;t have better quality of that night). &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24788008846/in/album-72157664241091486/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1498/24788008846_5083b8942d_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2016-01-01 01.00.17&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Dave and Kazuki&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24696421002/in/album-72157664241091486/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1445/24696421002_f7095e5d15_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hSikL&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Apart from being a great singer who got fined about four times for singing too loudly on NYE, A-Mei is also a gay icon, as can be seen from the rainbows in this picture: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/24446622699/in/album-72157664241091486/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1706/24446622699_70fa14d2d2_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2016-01-01 00.49.53&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the song that made the crowd go wild was &lt;em&gt;San tian san ye&lt;/em&gt; 三天三夜 &amp;lsquo;Three days and three nights&amp;rsquo;. In the previous video it can be found at 1:12:30. The whole crowd went completely crazy with this girl. And I love how her voice is &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; broken at the end of the concert. That&amp;rsquo;s how I think KTV should end, otherwise you&amp;rsquo;re doing something wrong. The lyrics of the song are really funny:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I&#39;m not tired at all
I&#39;ve been dancing for three days and three nights
In my current mood I could drink water and get drunk Oh
Not tired at all
I&#39;m going to dance for three days and three nights more
My mood is so light I could fly



OK OK join my ranks
No K No K from day to night
Always always happy but not sad
No way no way who would say not to that?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that was about it for my holidays update. There are still some more pictures from pizza and dinner parties at the end of the semester to celebrate our survival. Of course, end of the semester also means saying goodbye to some of my friends who were here for the first semester and then went back home. Nice meeting you guys!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[flickr_set id=&amp;ldquo;72157663599568419&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Maybe the tower was experiencing ejaculatio praecox?&lt;/p&gt;
