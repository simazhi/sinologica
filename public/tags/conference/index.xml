&lt;p&gt;Time flies! This post will be a short recapitulation of some things that happened after the second semester started and I first went on a trip with my friends from Belgium (read &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; about it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/notorious-b-t-belgians-taiwan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). As such, I will write a bit about my work as a model (yes, I became somewhat of a model haha); my work in the field with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/saikin-hai-bubun-tuta-tu-bunun-i-am-a-bunun&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bunun people&lt;/a&gt;; my work as a host to people who visited me; my work as a visitor myself; and finally, my work as an academic, both in Taiwan as well as in the international community. Well, as a matter of fact, these things do not always feel like work, as you may guess from this blogpost. Here is a Taiwanese moon and campus picture to whet your reading appetite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35770647486/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4237/35770647486_cbfbef7c74_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170609_233509_763&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;wanna-be-on-top&#34;&gt;Wanna be on top?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, first things first, let&amp;rsquo;s not get carried away with this subtitle&amp;rsquo;s reference to the catchphrase of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Next_Top_Model&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Next Top Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, via-via (as everything goes in Chinese culture) I was asked to star — or at least participate — in a small commercial for a touristic app of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tour.ntpc.gov.tw/en-us/Video/List?wnd_id=154&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New Taipei City Travel Bureau&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look, shall we? Take out the popcorn and enjoy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I was contacted again by the director of that campaign to help for another touristy app called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wogogo.com/en/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wogogo&lt;/a&gt;. The app looks solid; if you want to book a tour guide, I would suggest checking it out. Here is a promotional picture, taken together with two dear friends of mine, Vera and Aude:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/34971323074/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4210/34971323074_014afe1d8b_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;2017-07-09_11-20-55&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s where my modelling career is at. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it will continue but both times I had a fun experience and if it fits in my schedule I might take on some more work like this. Here is some authentic behind the scenes footage of me taking selfies when the other coworkers weren&amp;rsquo;t looking, #exclusive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/34626659045/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4157/34626659045_32f6c09f73_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170310_151240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/34585204346/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4170/34585204346_a99c00fc0b_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170509_114919&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;bunun-fieldwork&#34;&gt;Bunun Fieldwork&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester I was working again with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunun_language&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bunun&lt;/a&gt; data, a language we had studied in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/saikin-hai-bubun-tuta-tu-bunun-i-am-a-bunun&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fieldwork&lt;/a&gt; last year. This time, the goal is assisting prof. &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~gilntu/Faculty/Li-May_Sung.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sung&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://corpus.linguistics.ntu.edu.tw/index_en.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Corpus of Formosan Languages&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of transcribed and analyzed texts that can teach us a lot about how different languages, in this case the Formosan (Austronesian) languages. Different from last year, however, was that we did not really go in the field, but the field came to us! Every Friday I met with Hanaivaz (watch some of her &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/_Slv7eTzOWs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;videos on youtube&lt;/a&gt;) and played recordings of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pearstories.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pear Stories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Frog-Where-Are-You-Boy/dp/0803728816&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frog Story — Frog where are you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, recorded by my fellow graduate student Eric, who together with another (already graduated student) Aarin, are the main participants of the project on Bunun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811336485/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4283/35811336485_250f32f489_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170616_172531_100&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this &amp;ldquo;totally natural, non-posed, non-filtered picture that was run through instagram&amp;rdquo; you can see Hanaivaz and me doing some work. It is intensive work, and also has an intensive after-work component, but I really like it as well. And I recently learned that I can continue my work starting in September, so I am looking forward to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-visits-to-taiwan&#34;&gt;Some visits to Taiwan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the category &amp;ldquo;visitors of Taiwan that I had the honour to meet up with&amp;rdquo; we had some fellow students from the summerschool at NTU that I attended in 2014, which first propelled me to apply for the programme I am in. There was the cool Antonio, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/japanese-linguistic-ninjal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;who I went to visit in Japan last year&lt;/a&gt; and who I consider to be my bro.] He brought his sister and his partner and just appeared super randomly in Taiwan. But every time I meet him it&amp;rsquo;s like the summer school was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/34240627780/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4190/34240627780_52715ed0de_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170414_220010&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the same statement goes for the wonderful Korean Jiye and the great Singaporean May Tay, not to be confused with the band May Day. Here is a picture of Jiyeah! (but for May I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35812522865/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4233/35812522865_debdb506cc_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jiyeah__Franzi_and_Snow_so_good_to_see_you_gurlzzz_______ntusummerplus2014&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;courses&#34;&gt;Courses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am mostly through with the course part of my PhD. In previous updates I explained how that is a way in which PhDs across the world seem to differ: in Taiwan at least you have to take a certain amount of courses, expressed in study credits, only after which you are eligible to graduate. Of course there are some other requirements to fulfil, but this is the stage I am/was at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811334675/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4263/35811334675_7e2fd3a6ca_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170602_193356_504&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;logical-analysis&#34;&gt;Logical Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took two main courses this semester. The first one was &amp;ldquo;logical analysis of language&amp;rdquo; (&lt;em&gt;yuyan de luoji fenxi&lt;/em&gt; 語言的邏輯分析), in which Prof. Hsieh posed the challenge to think about linguistic problems based on small data sets that had been slightly simplified. The course was conducted in relation to the preselections of Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s participant of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ioling.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;International Linguistics Olympiad&lt;/a&gt;. In general I think it gave a nice overview of the basic components of linguistic theories, as well as some reflection on the nature of language. There was also some &lt;a href=&#34;http://conlang.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;conlang&lt;/a&gt;-inspired coursework. For instance, here you see me and my group mate Nick having a conversation in a made-up sign language. At the time it was only a few days old so it&amp;rsquo;s more pidginy than creoly in nature, but we managed to communicate. Subtitles provided!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;seminar-of-cognitive-grammar&#34;&gt;Seminar of Cognitive Grammar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second course I took was the Seminar of Advanced Cognitive Grammar, which is our lab meeting as well. This semester we focused on Cognitive Grammar (from Langacker 1987 onwards) and Radical Construction Grammar (from Croft 2001 onwards). I may have found a source of material that will help me to answer one of the questions I have been interested in all along: how did ideophones develop diachronically in Chinese? Without going into too much detail, for this paper I was concerned about the methodology, from a technical perspective. The question most researchers are grappling with (or should be) is the source of their data (I am using historical texts), and how to transform raw material into analyzable and usable data. For the moment, I have devised a float chart that should take my data from raw material to slightly enriched material ready for analaysis. Here&amp;rsquo;s the chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35029500103/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4277/35029500103_f66d93f226_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Schermafbeelding 2017-06-27 om 17.32.23&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the question I asked, related to ideophones, was what patterns would emerge from the data. I noticed an interesting phenomenon of post-ideophone markers, which I will follow up on later. Without explaining it too much here, I just want to show the figures I used for the analysis or the motivated explanation in terms of Cognitive Grammar — mostly because I am proud of them, ha:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/34998969564/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4208/34998969564_430d3899c2_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Schermafbeelding 2017-06-27 om 22.37.07&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;魯道衰&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35670057182/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4205/35670057182_6148efc52d_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Schermafbeelding 2017-06-28 om 09.28.33&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“洙泗之間，殷殷如也”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was also special about this paper is that it was largely written when I was already back at home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;home-and-away&#34;&gt;Home and away&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew home the 24th of June, after the last week of final presentations. As usual we had had the celebratory dinner with Lu &lt;em&gt;laoshi&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s group. It was a very cozy evening after a full(!) day of final term presentations - a marathon as it were – held at my Vietnamese classmate Carol&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/hotnutstw/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vietnamese restaurant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after rushing out of my dorm the next day because of the imminent construction works this summer I flew home on the 24th. I arrived the next day in Amsterdam and travelled home to Belgium, only to leave again after one or two hours. One of my best friends Céline had an engagement party in Bièrghes, located in the Middle-Of-Nowhere-city-stan right below Brussels. So we drove, and drove, and went up the highway and off the highway and up and off and up and off until finally we arrived. Here is a cool picture of me with Céline and other presidents of Eoos, past-present-and-future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811339195/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4257/35811339195_ebc43bb4f8_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170625_184209_453&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The even was a lot of fun. I think Céline and Joes (not pronounced like the plural of &amp;lsquo;Joe&amp;rsquo;, but rather like [yu:s]) really fit together and I wish them a happy marriage together! Here they are showing off their literacy skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811469145/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4215/35811469145_e7e53ac301_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170625_162930&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;globetrotters&#34;&gt;Globetrotters&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that event we went back home, from Bièrghes, located in the Middle-Of-Nowhere-city-stan, all the way to the megapolis that constitutes Loenhout. I had a nice week chilling at home, while also writing the aforementioned paper and some more. We, i.e. me and CJ, also explored a bit the beautiful landscapes of Loenhout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35001305673/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4264/35001305673_f442ea1a78_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20170628_211844_HDR&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then one day we went to Antwerp, and visited the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rubenshuis.be/nl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rubenshuis&lt;/a&gt;. Beautiful paintings, the best paintings, painted with big hands, comes from &amp;ldquo;Hand werpen&amp;rdquo; (&amp;lsquo;throw hand&amp;rsquo;), it was the biggest hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also a trip to &amp;lsquo;Hellhole Brussels&amp;rsquo; which was essentially a Belgians in Taiwan reunion. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/notorious-b-t-belgians-taiwan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Click here to read more about my adventures with Cedric, Ruben and Isabelle&lt;/a&gt;. It was fun, though we didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;manil&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course I should mention the Sinology reunion orchestrated by my good friend Lai Man. Thank you for hosting us and the whole gang!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35001189393/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4258/35001189393_5afbb561f9_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170702_181810_369&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;ifg17&#34;&gt;#IFG17&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, to wrap up, I will tell you something about the conference I attended in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. It was called &amp;ldquo;Iconicity Focus Group Workshop&amp;rdquo;, hence the hashtag #IFG17. I presented a poster over there, which talked about the weather in Chinese. Well, it talked about weather-related ideophones and iconicity in the writing system. It was hosted at the Max Planck Institute of Psycholinguistics, coincidentally the only other place I had applied for a PhD a few years back. I am more than happy at the university I am at, and now I was extra more than happy to be able to have a look at the MPI and its surroundings and meet lots of interesting people. It also inspired me in some ways for my research so I consider the conference a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35422614670/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4236/35422614670_d00ebb0e39_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170708_213215_216&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is my picture in front of the poster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/34971117714/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4277/34971117714_546ce08e0a_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170706_145113_978&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/33813675/The_Thunder_Rolls_Iconicity_and_ideophones_in_Chinese_meteorological_expressions?s=t&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;read my poster when you click on this link here&lt;/a&gt; (please do!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;no-regen-in-nijmegen&#34;&gt;No regen in Nijmegen?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then finally, some pictures of the second oldest city of the Netherlands, Nijmegen. We had beautiful weather and also good food, but unfortunately I was not able to enjoy the city for that long, being away at my conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35422615620/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4261/35422615620_6ca857a515_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170705_210750_504&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/35811368485/in/album-72157686045485815/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4212/35811368485_a866d4a28c_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20170708_191846_719&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I had to look back in my archive to find a picture I had taken of the rain in Taipei, about a month ago, in order to find a picture to contrast it with the drought and warm weather, even heatwaves we have had here in Belgium and the Netherlands the last few weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s also the final picture of this update, so cherish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;〜〜&lt;em&gt;Konnichiwa mina san&lt;/em&gt; こんにちはみなさん〜〜&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my SEA roundtrip to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/thomas-in-thailand&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Phuket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/shanghai-and-suzhou&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; where I visited some of my friends, I arrived back in Taiwan. I was running in Pudong airport in Shanghai to get my flight because I had to queue for two hours just to get through the security check, but it turned out to be no problem — apparently China occasionally &lt;em&gt;bullies&lt;/em&gt; Taiwanese airlines, resulting in a delay of two, three hours. Maybe we should call this a case of &lt;em&gt;sai weng zhi ma&lt;/em&gt; 塞翁之馬 &amp;ldquo;The old man at the border&amp;rsquo;s horse&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand this Chinese saying; it basically means that bad things can become good things and vice versa. Anyway, the main topic of this blogpost will be my participation in a conference in Japan, at the end of December 2016. So in order to get there, let me first quickly do an overview of the time between my arrival back in Taiwan and before going to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;remember-remember-the-fifth-of-november&#34;&gt;Remember, remember, the fifth of November&amp;hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November was a pretty normal month, filled with the mundane passage of time (read: whatever other philosophical paraphrase you are into that describes that the days went by). Only two notable things happened and I am only going to tell you one :-). The other is an event to celebrate Belgium&amp;rsquo;s King day (I did not know that was a thing), but I got to meet up with some Belgian friends of mine, as well as take a selfie with Tintin, a.k.a. Kuifje.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32566625825/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/634/32566625825_f86b0b60d2_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20161116_224541&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;once-upon-a-december&#34;&gt;Once upon a December&amp;hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when December rolled in, and Taiwan stayed warm, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any real Christmassy feeling. However, I was too busy to notice, because I was watching reruns of &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt;. Later I wrote a paper about it for Prof. Lu&amp;rsquo;s 呂 course on Linguistics in Animation. &lt;strong&gt;If you are interested or have comments or questions about the draft, please feel free to comment. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/32184348/The_Blending_of_Bending_World-building_in_Avatar_The_Last_Airbender_and_Legend_of_Korra?s=t&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;You can find the paper here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, a funny anecdote: I mistyped this once as &lt;em&gt;Aribender&lt;/em&gt; in a first draft of my paper, which prompted my Japanese speaking friend to burst out in laughter — &lt;em&gt;ari&lt;/em&gt; 蟻 is Japanese for &amp;lsquo;ant&amp;rsquo;. Ha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let us talk about Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31960235060/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/640/31960235060_e4dbf5fec5_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20161218_080543&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;ninjal&#34;&gt;NINJAL&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew to Japan to participate in a conference called &lt;a href=&#34;http://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/mimetics/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Mimetics in Japanese and Other Languages of the World&amp;rsquo; (⽇日本語と世界諸⾔言語のオノマトペ)&lt;/a&gt;. I was superexcited, not in the least because presenting my poster would give me the opportunity to meet many important people in my field. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/31197390/Ideophones_in_Premodern_Chinese_Revisting_Dingemanses_Implicational_Hierarchy?s=t&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;You can find the poster itself if you click here&lt;/a&gt; (also, let me know if these links don&amp;rsquo;t do what they are supposed to do please).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32303422870/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/506/32303422870_705b40d79c_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;received_10210952006026398&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32560524581/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/413/32560524581_a6b6fb980d_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20161218_160749&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference itself was held in the NINJAL. I know what you are thinking — NINJAs!!!!! Well, I must admit I also thought of NINJAs of Linguistics (that was what the L was doing, &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt;). Turns out they had just had a good brainstorming session, because NINJAL is (of course!) short for National INstitute of JApanese Linguistics. _shinobi_style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/33408682066/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3791/33408682066_35901a092d_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;0001_xlarge&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place where this event was held was &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachikawa,_Tokyo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tachikawa 立川市&lt;/a&gt;, a nice little city next to Tokyo most people haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of. It was freezing cold (寒いですねー) and I was very glad I had packed my winter outfit. That being said, Japan was so nice. The weather was very clear, the 711s were even more convenient than in Taiwan, and the people were very friendly. I must say I did benefit from having studied a year of Japanese in Leuven before, and some of the most frequent expressions were really useful in daily life. Okay, so back to the conference: Team Taiwan — as I unofficially call Prof. Lu, me and our Korean buddy Ian — arrived in the early morning of the first day, having passed the Japanese Ikea, which reminded me of the Ikea in Breda (Netherlands). Or maybe all Ikeas are look-a-likes. I haven&amp;rsquo;t made my mind up yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32217396911/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/646/32217396911_3c23903723_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20161217_082216_HDR&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31839473994/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/626/31839473994_271ed959ed_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;received_10210952010226503&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important part (and most nervous part) of the conference was of course the presentation of my poster. Here are some pictures of how that went down. I must say that the people who I talked to asked some really interesting questions, but they did seem to agree with my baseline. So I wrote a paper about it for our seminar class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/mimetics/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; was organized very well and the presentations were generally very interesting. Of &lt;em&gt;specialest&lt;/em&gt; interest to me were Janis Nuckolls and Mark Dingemanse. So go check them out if you have time and feel like doing that, or even better, when you have a burning hunger for knowledge about Quichua and Siwu. This group photo is the last I will write about this conference here, but I would like to go again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tik-tok-tokyo&#34;&gt;Tik Tok Tokyo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you survived the serious part of this blog update! Because I had a Christmas party and my TA job waiting for me back in Taipei on Wednesday, my time in Tokyo itself was quite limited — more precisely to 1 day. Fortunately, I was able to make most of it. Firstly, my dear friend Antonio, who I met in NTU during a summer school two summers ago lives in Tokyo, so I was ultra thrilled to be able to see him again and I would like to thank him for having me over! Gracias!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31839472324/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/428/31839472324_fd6a917890_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;received_10154187004328595&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day I spent in Tokyo I did the following things (I must admit it was hard to fit it all in one streamlined trip, but I did manage):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasukuni_shrine&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Yasukuni Shrine&lt;/a&gt; 靖国神社&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asakusa_Shrine&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Asakusa Shrine&lt;/a&gt; 浅草神社&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk around in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shibuya&lt;/a&gt; 渋谷区&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat sushi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to an onsen, Japanese hotsprings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;yasukuni-shrine&#34;&gt;Yasukuni Shrine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to this place because every time the prime minister Abe Shinzo visits it, China gets angry and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. In this shrine, founded by the Meiji Emperor in 1869 commemorates all those who have died for the Empire. It also houses some war criminals and has a history museum built next to it that tells a &lt;em&gt;slightly twisted&lt;/em&gt; version of events. Here are pictures (also, notice the very cool metal &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;torii&lt;/a&gt; gate in the first picture).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31960294590/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/479/31960294590_8138cfcd56_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20161219_101904_HDR&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my visit I observed the locals and the way they performed their rituals (washing hands, throwing money, and clapping). It is very interesting to see religion still being kept alive. Also, I discovered the Japanese(?) custom of collection stamps in a dedicated stamp booklet. It looks cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;asakusa-shrine&#34;&gt;Asakusa Shrine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shrine is one of the oldest in Tokyo and one of the most frequented. It is located near Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s Skytree tower, which I unfortunately could not visit because of time constraints. The area is crowded with tourists and Japanese riksha boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shibuya&#34;&gt;Shibuya&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to see Shibuya because of two reasons: the statue of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hachiko&lt;/a&gt;, the loyal dog that kept waiting day in day out for its master, even after its master passed away. Sad story. I met Antonio at this statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/31497510274/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/711/31497510274_001932b812_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20161219_185821&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason for Shibuya was to cross the street. You must think I am crazy, but if I show you this clip of World Order in Shibuya, you will know why — hint: it&amp;rsquo;s the prototype of Japanese businessmen crossing in all directions. It&amp;rsquo;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sushi&#34;&gt;Sushi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antonio took me to a sushi place and it was sushi and sashimi I ate. I discovered I quite like real wasabi — we had to grind it ourselves —, but not that green fake factory flubber that you usually get. Because food was a big thing on this trip, I am just going to put some pictures here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;onsen&#34;&gt;Onsen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that night, Antonio took me to an onsen. No pictures of that though :-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;back-to-taipei&#34;&gt;Back to Taipei&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning I had to say goodbye to Antonio and Antokyo. It was quite sad I thought, because I would have loved to stay longer. I know I will be back. Here is a fake picture of Antonio crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/32339826495/in/album-72157679902784915/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/660/32339826495_b0180b7fc8_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20161220_082856&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my plane flew from Haneda airport, I could see the Fuji mountain, one of Japan&amp;rsquo;s symbols and that occurs twice in pictures above. I watched the movie &lt;em&gt;Kimi no Na wa&lt;/em&gt; 君の名は &amp;ldquo;Your Name&amp;rdquo;, Japan&amp;rsquo;s best selling animated movie, and for a reason. When I was back I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop myself from relistening the soundtrack over and over. But alas, the warm December breeze of Taiwan was already spottable from my aircraft as I descended into Songshan airport, listening to whatever songs the plane had to offer. I longed for Japan, and not even books, nor drugs could help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily that night was the Christmas party of our department. We performed and had lots of fun. I think these kind of events are good for the spirit of a department and I wish it would happen in the summer semester as well. The real Christmas Eve I celebrated with some of my department mates and a nice visit by my Spanish friend Celia with whom I spent some days afterwards, going to restaurants she likes. Last pictures for today!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In this post I talk a bit how the rest of my summer holidays went. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/leiden&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt; I showed what I did in the beginning of the summer: go to Leiden in the Netherlands to attend a summer school of Digital Humanities and Chinese Studies. Now we continue the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;belgium-i&#34;&gt;Belgium (I)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to Belgium after my super crazy adventures in the Netherlands — well, normal crazy adventures. I was home once again, though it felt something or someone was missing.Turns out I was missing my dog; every time we parked the car, I was mentally preparing to be greeted by him (or in more recent years the other way around) and to take him for a walk, only now it was empty. I wrote more about losing him &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/belgie/brought-together-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in this post a few months ago&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from the necessary adjustments to this new situation I really had a happy time being back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it got even happier when I was visited by my classmate Iju and her sister who were travelling around Europe after attending a conference in Berlin. They stayed at my place in the very little town of Loenhout, I made pancakes for them, we went to get Belgian fries etc. They went to Bruges by themselves (I was a bad guide that day because I had a powerpoint presentation to attend to) and I took them to Antwerp. It was really nice to have them there and I hope to welcome them again in Belgium in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29300580726/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8037/29300580726_df432ef85a_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160719_201531&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29067097613/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8369/29067097613_0232fa406b_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160721_115939&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29065565364/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8310/29065565364_355e7b8a28_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160721_104732_HDR&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;berlin&#34;&gt;Berlin&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a small week or so, it was time for me to leave to Berlin. As I walked about in the new-and-improved airport of Brussels (you probably know what happened in there on 22 March 2016), I hoped this was my airplane:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29067094423/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8179/29067094423_3d5869156d_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160727_140455&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I had to make do with a normal plane instead of Tintin&amp;rsquo;s rocket. I flew with Brussels Airlines, but I was slightly bothered by the bad service:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt; &#34;Would you like to buy something from the bar? What are you? EasyJet? Ryan Air? No, you are supposed to be an airline of a normal to higher class, I guess you could offer me one glass of water by yourself no?&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I arrived safely in Berlin and after finding my hostel I went for a brisk city walk. My first night in Berlin was not the best ever; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t afraid or anything but I felt not really at ease, probably due to me losing my way on my way back. Still, I had seen some pretty good things on my first night, including the Brandenburg Tor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;museuminsel&#34;&gt;Museuminsel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day was much better, I had to register for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.hu-berlin.de/isacg9/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;International Symposium of Ancient Chinese Grammar (ISACG 9)&lt;/a&gt; in the late afternoon so I decided to do some museum hopping. Being unable to enjoy the full benefit of the 3-day museum pass I chose to tackle the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Island&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Museum Island&lt;/a&gt; (Museuminsel), a collection of five museums that hold some nice treasures. I first went to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_Museum&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bode Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which houses a medievalish collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29065575344/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8600/29065575344_b68ba67f34_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160728_110003&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29692084255/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8414/29692084255_e1941a58ab_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160728_110257&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I walked to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Neues Museum (New Museum)&lt;/a&gt; because I had heard they have &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti_Bust&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the head of Nefertiti&lt;/a&gt; over there. They did and it was wonderful. I think I stayed for at least fifteen minutes just staring at that royal head — you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to take pictures of it and there are three guards near it so I just wanted to let this moment soak in. Did you know, when I was little I wanted to become an Egyptologist when I was older. It&amp;rsquo;s funny that I chose another area to work on now, but the fascination with Egypt and especially Egyptian mythology remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the pictures you can see me and my bro &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Heinrich Schliemann&lt;/a&gt;, the one who discovered Troy; a small statue of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekhmet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sekhmet&lt;/a&gt;, the lion-headed goddess of war; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopic_jar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;canopic jars&lt;/a&gt; to put organs in during the mummification process; the Egyptian god &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Thoth&lt;/a&gt;, the ibis-headed god of writing; a bas-relief of monotheistic pharaohs &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Akhenaten&lt;/a&gt; (Echnaton) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nefertiti&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nefertiti&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this I went to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pergamon_Museum&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pergamom Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which unfortunately is under construction; ironically the Pergamum wing cannot be visited at this time. However, I did see the glorious lapis lazuli &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishtar_Gate&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gate of Ishtar&lt;/a&gt;, originally excavated in Babylon. Oh My Ishtar, it was so beautiful. It was hard to believe how the colour could stay so beautiful after al this time. I think I stood in awe for half an hour; the guards were looking at me suspiciously but I just wanted to let this sink in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I paid a visit to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Nationalgalerie&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alte Nationalgalerie&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of paintings and a few sculptures. Here are some that I thought were cool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we come to the last museum I visited that day. If it was exhausting for you to read this, imagine how much more it was for me, who spent the whole day there! The last museum is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Museum&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Altes Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which houses the classical collection. I got to see some really famous sculptures, as well as take some nifty pictures with some of them. This often took many attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;isacg-9&#34;&gt;ISACG 9&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, off to more serious matters. I had become more comfortable in Berlin by this daylit exploration of the Museum Island, which also happened to be situated very closely to the university where the symposium was to be held. So the next day the symposium started, in a beautiful room of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_University_of_Berlin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Humboldt Universität zu Berlin&lt;/a&gt; (when I asked people where the other Humboldt Universitäte happened to be, they didn&amp;rsquo;t get my joke. I hope it is funny anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29401219360/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8116/29401219360_74742c5c03_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160729_085351&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symposium was organized mainly by the lovely Barbara Meisterernst, an expert on Han-dynasty (and before and after) verbal aspect. One of the reasons I really wanted to come here was that in a point in the past (about one and a half year ago) I had become interested in her work and mailed her about possible PhD positions. The answer was negative at the time but she did come across as a really caring person, which also showed in the organization of the symposium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29401212240/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8852/29401212240_13a378bcb3_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160729_090828&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the attendants of the symposium were Chinese or Taiwanese professors. I felt there was a tendency to use very formal ways to solve linguistic problems but there were also a few nuggets of functional-cognitive insights that really struck with me. And, apart from that, I felt really happy to get to know these people, as it shows research on Premodern Chinese is far from dead. One lesser point was meeting the person whose book I used to write my bachelor paper. I guess some idols can lose their pedestal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was my turn to do my presentation, my audience wasn&amp;rsquo;t super big. It didn&amp;rsquo;t come as a big surprise, since the parallel session had big names like Alain Peyraube as the chair and the aforementioned pedestal loser as a speaker. I had, however, a really friendly chair &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ling.nthu.edu.tw/faculty/cflien/CFLIEN/Welcome.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lien Chinfa 連金發&lt;/a&gt;. And given that the speaker right before me didn&amp;rsquo;t show up, I still had a decent audience of really interested people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did my presentation on &amp;ldquo;Ideophones in Old Chinese: The case of the &lt;em&gt;Shijing&lt;/em&gt; 詩經&amp;rdquo; and got some useful comments, for which I would like to thank my audience should they be reading this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/28712704233/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8147/28712704233_0d3fc817e7_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;13913571_10207275231980434_5897020159869672352_o&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symposium was ended with a dinner that brought us closer together in a more informal setting. I was happy because most of the young kids (those -30 year olds) got to sit together, and afterwards we discovered a nice beer place. Denying my Belgian heritage, I drank mojito and discussed events of the conference and other stories with a few people until the bar closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-war-side-of-berlin&#34;&gt;the War side of Berlin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I had some two days to explore the city, I decided to do some more recent things than what the Museuminsel had offered me a few days before. So I first went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Gallery&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;East Side Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, a 1.3 km stretch of Berlin Wall that has been graffitied and acts as a monument of freedom. Below is a picture of me and the most iconic painting, the Bruderkuss (Fraternal kiss), a.k.b. its real name &lt;em&gt;My God, Help Me to Survive this Deadly Love&lt;/em&gt; (German: &lt;em&gt;Mein Gott, hilf mir, diese tödliche Liebe zu überleben&lt;/em&gt;; Russian: «Господи! Помоги мне выжить среди этой смертной любви»).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29401222220/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8193/29401222220_2cc162cc33_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160731_113619&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I explored the land that lay beyond the Museuminsel. The Dom of Berlin and also the very cool Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this I took the S-Bahn (I have become an S/U-Bahn expert in this small week; no longer do I need the sentence &amp;ldquo;Ich weiße es nicht, ich bin auch ein Turist&amp;rdquo;) to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_building&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bundestag, f.k.a. the Reichstag&lt;/a&gt;. This is where the German parliament holds meetings. You can visit the dome if you make an appointment on time. Unfortunately, my schema was heavily restricted by the conference and there were some restoration works in progress. Nevertheless, I made an appointment to go and remembered about it five minutes before I had to be there, when I was in my bed the first day&amp;hellip; Maybe another time then ha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29581858572/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8463/29581858572_464ace9438_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160731_122919_HDR&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly I went to see the darker side of Berlin with that stuff that happened in the 1930s and 1940s. I saw the former HQ of the Gestapo and also the monument to the Jews. It made me silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29068416203/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8417/29068416203_7042b79c9c_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160731_141016&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/29065659344/in/album-72157673893504925/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8882/29065659344_0e76650d08_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_20160731_164750&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of a transformational experience in Berlin. At first I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the city, but through seeing things, meeting people, going places I slowly began to appreciate it and I know I will go there again in the future, because there is still so much left unexplored. A pleased man, I went back home — once again in a normal plane and not Tintin&amp;rsquo;s rocket.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s update is the second part of a double post that aims at filling you in with some details of my life here. This part is the more academic part about conferences; the other part &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/belgie/brought-together-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;you can find here&lt;/a&gt;. As always, comments are welcome on all kinds of platforms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conferences&#34;&gt;Conferences&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conference. That is the key-word of this update. An English word originating from Latin &lt;em&gt;con-ferre&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;together-bring&amp;rsquo; (read: &amp;lsquo;bring together&amp;rsquo;), passing through French. Well we are talking about academic conferences here, &amp;lsquo;cause I just started doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I had done presentations for friends, maybe foes, classmates etc. but I never really attended a conference before. This is in contrast to one of the requirements of the master&amp;rsquo;s programme here at the GIL of NTU, viz. you have to attend an international conference (it&amp;rsquo;s not a requirement of the PhD programme; however, it&amp;rsquo;s strongly advised). In Belgium this was kind of impossible or at least impractical because most masters in the humanities are only one year long. So it was kind of exciting for me when I decided to submit proposals in order to go speak at a conference this year. That&amp;rsquo;s why I will try to describe the process I went through this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;finding-conferences&#34;&gt;Finding conferences&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I had to find out about conferences. For me before, this had always been some sort of difficult point. I mean, how do you find out about it long enough beforehand in order for you to write a decent proposal that hopefully incorporates some of the work you have been doing until then? Wow, that is a long sentence. It all became more clear to me this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to subscribe &amp;lsquo;social networks&amp;rsquo; for the field you are in. In my case that is mostly &lt;a href=&#34;http://linguistlist.org/indexfd.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linguistlist&lt;/a&gt;. Or at least you have to know about it, so you can check vacancies and other interesting stuff regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You become a member of certain &amp;lsquo;clubs&amp;rsquo; — if that is the right word to put it. For instance, I am a (student) member of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sinalumni.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;alumni organisation Sinalumni&lt;/a&gt; for ex-sinology students, &lt;a href=&#34;http://chinesestudies.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the European Association for Chinese Studies (EACS)&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cognitivelinguistics.org/en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;International Cognitive Linguistics Association (ICLA)&lt;/a&gt; for which I was kind of convinced by my previous teacher Dirk Geeraerts. There&amp;rsquo;s many more where those came from (internet) and it&amp;rsquo;s a good way to stay updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get updates from your department. In this case, our dear Mei-Ling sends us regular updates on interesting talks (my department hosts many) and interesting conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luck. Yes, you have to have a wee bit of luck. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a poster you see somewhere, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a LinkedIn post, a facebook link, something someone tells you about, a random string of letters you type into google&amp;hellip; Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in my cases it was mostly LinguistList and the department that told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;submitting-a-proposal&#34;&gt;Submitting a proposal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you found a conference, you will want to submit a proposal; at least, if your aim is to be super actively involved there. If you want to attend (and mingle with some people), that is also okay of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  
&gt; 
&gt; &#34;The more you come out, the better.&#34;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote my first submissions around December 2015 and got answers pretty soon after that. I submitted for CLDC 8 (see below), a summer school in Leiden (see future blog post) and a symposium in Berlin (see future blog post). And then I got notified that I got accepted, which I was thrilled about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a warm-up and given my non-existing prior experience with conferences, I decided to attend one so I could see how the show rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;ncl-17-2016-tatung-university&#34;&gt;NCL 17 (2016, Tatung University)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://%20http://ncl17.afl.ttu.edu.tw/ncl17/#index&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NCL 17, the (Taiwanese) National Conference on Linguistics.&lt;/a&gt; It was hosted at Tatung University &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatung_University&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;大同大學&lt;/a&gt;. It was very interesting to see; especially because I got to see my senpai 學長 Chester present a paper he had been writing last semester, as well as to see my supervisor Lu Chiarung and my other teachers be present and just in general show my face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27315809586/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7666/27315809586_43253004a2_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;NCL&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27074016400/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7319/27074016400_1cb2e7cb42_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Chester speaks&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27349191045/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7474/27349191045_199bb64024_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lu laoshi speaks&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cldc-8-2016-taipei-university&#34;&gt;CLDC 8 (2016, Taipei University)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the main part of this post, as it is the first conference I spoke at. &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~gilntu/cldc/2016/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CLDC, the Conference on Language, Discourse, and Cognition&lt;/a&gt; is a biennial conference organised by my university NTU. It originated from a smaller set of discussions and has grown out to be a bigger conference that welcomes both Taiwanese as well as foreign talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/26744157283/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7046/26744157283_f526703b36_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sally and Mergen setting up the posters&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the conference itself was held from 13 to 14 May, the first pre-session by keynote speaker &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~hbaayen/contact.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Harald Baayen&lt;/a&gt; happened a day earlier, when he showed us the wondrous world of R — that&amp;rsquo;s a computer programme for statistics, for those who R ignorant of this fact (note: in Dutch I would have said that &amp;ldquo;je geen R-varing hebt&amp;rdquo;). Professor Baayen is very famous in computational linguistics and his talk was interesting; the subsequent hands-on session was more difficult to follow though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we had our first set of presentations, &lt;a href=&#34;http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~gilntu/cldc/2016/program.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;you can find the conference programme here&lt;/a&gt;. In the morning my previous teacher, Professor &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/qlvl/dirkg.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dirk Geeraerts&lt;/a&gt; from KU Leuven gave a talk on onomasiological variation and lectometry, especially with regard to the lexical field of clothing terms in Flanders vs. the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27074194090/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7277/27074194090_2b968d07b0_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dirk Geeraerts &#39;onomasiological variation and lectometry&#39;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was filled with very interesting presentations and a poster session for which some of my classmates had submitted a proposal, e.g. Aarin about the &lt;em&gt;dapat&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;to get&amp;rsquo; in Indonesian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/26767986124/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7402/26767986124_587bb358bc_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Aarin &#39;dapat&#39;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night there was a banquet, where I finally got to eat dryish spaghetti — as opposed to the variant that is too moist that is served ubiquitously here. And, I got to sit at the table with the &amp;lsquo;grown-ups&amp;rsquo; (read: with the professors), talking in Dutch and English and Chinese with friendly people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27277222732/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7096/27277222732_df352742b9_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banquet&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27349377885/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7171/27349377885_df10fea214_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;banquet&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very next day it was my turn to deliver my speech that I had prepared together with my supervisor. It was entitled &amp;ldquo;The distribution of ideophones in Tang poems: A variatonist perspective&amp;rdquo;. In short, I summarized findings from my MA thesis last year as a corpus-driven approach to look at three variations &lt;em&gt;mangmang&lt;/em&gt; 茫茫, &lt;em&gt;mangmang&lt;/em&gt; 芒芒 and &lt;em&gt;cangmang&lt;/em&gt; 蒼茫 in a corpus-based way. Turns out that while all three depict &amp;lsquo;wide, open, vast&amp;rsquo;, the ones with the water radical (the two falling and one raising stripes at the left side) occurred in different places and different times closer to water than the one with only grass (that&amp;rsquo;s the second one with the two plus signs (++) at the top). It was a good pilot study and I am happy to announce that we will try to publish it in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you would like to see the powerpoint of the presentation, but if you do, I can send it or in case requests are overwhelming, I might upload it here. Let me know! Anyway, here are some pictures (I am still waiting for better quality pictures than Facebook quality):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/26768378453/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7048/26768378453_461e586c25_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;presentation&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/26768378463/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7201/26768378463_4bd4780e35_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;13220752_10204599605349173_1628020229323652229_o&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27277223262/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7624/27277223262_a009432dc6_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;13245230_561516674010353_4933154692913286555_n&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27315998836/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7086/27315998836_be0d8c131e_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160513_105558&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was followed by another host of interesting presentations. I think my favourite one was the one right behind me, by Hsin-Yen who talked about iconicity in paintings. Later that night we went for tea shopping with our esteemed guests from the low countries and I had dinner with Prof. Geeraerts and Po-Wei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27277223062/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7731/27277223062_0702702a72_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tea time&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the tea tasting I had a really funny yet embarrassing story that I want to share with you. First we were helped by a very old man, who turned out to be about 85 years old. At one point he left to take a rest and the woman in the picture above helped us further out. I asked her if the old man was her father (&lt;em&gt;fuqin&lt;/em&gt; 父親), to which she mumbled something back that I understood as &lt;em&gt;agong&lt;/em&gt; 阿公, the Taiwanese Mandarin variant for &amp;lsquo;grandfather&amp;rsquo;. So, to be certain, I repeated the question, and she was like &amp;ldquo;no, no, my &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lao&lt;/strong&gt;gong&lt;/em&gt; 老公 &amp;lsquo;husband&amp;rsquo;. Turned out she was 65 years old. Will I ever be able to guess the age of my Asian friends??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/26767387294/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7680/26767387294_9bd43f23e1_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dinner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only time I would see Po-Wei that night as it was also the grand finale of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eurovision.tv/page/timeline&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Eurovision Song Contest&lt;/a&gt; (Eurosong for the Dutch speaking friends). Ever since the beginning of this academic year it has been clear that he is a super fan and I am happy that we could arrange to watch the competition on big screen in our department, even if it was only the two of us who watched, starting at 3 AM. This, by the way, is not the first time I watched this &amp;lsquo;late&amp;rsquo; [I like to watch this live], as I had done the same with Joke in Suzhou two years before. Anyways, Po-Wei was ecstatic when his favourite contestant, Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s Jamala with &lt;em&gt;1944&lt;/em&gt;, won the contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27349379705/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7012/27349379705_dd7170e870_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Eurovision!&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27251823242/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7457/27251823242_f3f50c9a99_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Eurovision&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the real winners that night were presenters Måns Zelmerlöw and Petra Mede who performed what they thought to be the &amp;ldquo;perfect Eurovision song&amp;rdquo;. Of course, it was an act that would have been disqualified in the real competition — having more than six people on stage and going easily over the maximum duration of 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, naturally I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep (2 hours in total) and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to catch up. The next day I guided Prof. Geeraerts and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/chiangwenyulab/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof. Chiang Wen-yu&lt;/a&gt; in the Palace Museum (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/blog/visit-from-vietnam&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;see this blog post for more information&lt;/a&gt;) and I humbly displayed all the sinological knowledge that is still stored in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun times, but even conferences have to come to an end. Or maybe especially conferences have to come to an end. Anyway, the next day there was a post-conference talk by Prof. Geeraerts on clothing terms (&lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;) and onomasiological salience and entrenchment, which was very interesting. Here is a picture of him talking with my Japanese friend Saito. This was followed by a lunch and that was that; but it&amp;rsquo;s not that for this update!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27278852771/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7397/27278852771_a86b88b6bb_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Talking with Saito&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I went to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nhcue.edu.tw/~IsCLL-15/en_index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;International Symposium on Chinese Languages and Linguistics&lt;/a&gt;, which was held in Hsinchu. It was very interesting, with highlights on the first day in the second session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27349493465/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7617/27349493465_d9a296f290_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hshinchu University of Education&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/26742207244/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7410/26742207244_2e41854fa5_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IsCLL&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, the real attractions were keynote speakers Randy LaPolla, a big name in Asian linguistics, and Adele Goldberg, one of the big names in Construction Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27349488645/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7441/27349488645_f810c33c26_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Me and Adele Goldberg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these two, it was a good opportunity to network and I made new friends, e.g. three graduate students; with two of them I went to a bar with Belgian beer later. I also bumped into some big names in Formosan linguistics (the native languages of Taiwan): Elisabeth Zeitoun and fellow Belgian Rik De Busser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/86097314@N03/27074319380/in/album-72157668279194300/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7726/27074319380_3e61ca9f44_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20160528_203231&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was it for this update, which ends considerably on a happier note &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/belgie/brought-together-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;than the previous one&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to see you next time my dear reading friends!&lt;/p&gt;
