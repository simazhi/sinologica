&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last time we did this, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/icons-we-live-by/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I showed you what my PLN looked like about a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. I advise you to read that first before you continue reading below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s update I will lay out how I generally go about the processing of research.
It&amp;rsquo;s a kind of habit I&amp;rsquo;ve been cultivating for a few years now, and it generally does pay off, but it did not come out of nowhere and I might have forgotten some of the sources that influenced me.
Since the basic process hasnt&amp;rsquo; really changed in the last year, I will first display again the picture from last update:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018/PLN_2017_research.png&#34; alt=&#34;PLN 2017&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I marked the research process with a purple frame.
So, let&amp;rsquo;s dig into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;finding-research-stuff&#34;&gt;Finding research stuff&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general we can break this first point down into two smaller processes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding the bibliographical records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finding the record itself to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-bibliographical-records&#34;&gt;Finding bibliographical records&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually this is the easiest part, because you will find references to what other researchers wrote in a variety of places: &lt;code&gt;books&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;articles&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;websites&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lectures&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;classes&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;by word of mouth&lt;/code&gt; etc.
If this reference is decent enough, you should have the &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;year&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;place of publishing (a publishing house or a journal)&lt;/code&gt;.
If not, well, bummer, but you can use some Google, database, or library magic in the hopes of finding the metadata of the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-record-itself&#34;&gt;Finding the record itself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My usual go-to practice is going to &lt;a href=&#34;scholar.google.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very large linked database of existing versions of different articles / chapters (I am going to refer to the thing we are looking for as the &lt;strong&gt;paper&lt;/strong&gt; in the rest of this update).
Now, Google scholar &lt;a href=&#34;http://ideophone.org/some-things-you-need-to-know-about-google-scholar/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;is also not without problems&lt;/a&gt;.
The question remains, however, if your institution has &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; to the paper you are looking for.
Usually that is okay, but for some you may be linked to the publisher, where you have to pay for access to the paper.
One of the more recent big issues in academia is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.veto.be/artikel/monopolieprijzen-van-uitgeverijen-brengen-onderzoekers-en-universiteiten-in-problemen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cry for more open-access&lt;/a&gt;, and we are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/03/economist-explains-23&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;still trying to find a viable model&lt;/a&gt; that does not waste the people&amp;rsquo;s tax money, but still keeps things like peer-review alive.
A really good model hasn&amp;rsquo;t been found yet, but I have the feeling &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/french-say-no-deal-springer-journal-fight-spreads&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;we are getting there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, assuming you do have access to the paper you want, what to do next &amp;mdash; that is the issue at stake in this update.
Let&amp;rsquo;s download the thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-reference-manager&#34;&gt;A reference manager&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think now we come at the heart of this update.
One of the better inventions in the last few years is that of reference managers: software you can put your bibliographical records in, and that help you spit out references in the style you want.
There are a few options out there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; and its alternative &lt;a href=&#34;https://juris-m.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Juris-M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://endnote.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Endnote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bibtex.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bibtex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bibdesk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mendeley.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mendeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these, Zotero and its spin-off Juris-M are my favourites, because they are open source and just do the job I want them to do.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s first quickly look at what Zotero can do for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7FOu94Ah85Y&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about this in a blog post at your own pace, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;http://ideophone.org/slides-for-a-hands-on-zotero-workshop/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this piece by Mark Dingemanse&lt;/a&gt;, which shows the fundamental usage of the software. I&amp;rsquo;ll show his presentation here as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async class=&#34;speakerdeck-embed&#34; data-id=&#34;2b7d44ceb02d4aa1bb441faf59356819&#34; data-ratio=&#34;1.33333333333333&#34; src=&#34;//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, once you get that down and get the basic usage of a reference manager, it is worth remembering that all of the previously mentioned reference managers get the same basic trick done.
However, I still like the open source (&lt;strong&gt;and thus free&lt;/strong&gt;) Zotero-like software best, because there are some customisations that will improve its usefulness.
Of course, as the noun suggests, these customisations, are, well, custom, and fit my personal style best.
What you do with your references eventually remains your business, although I can only hope that you at least reflect on how to optimize it.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how I customized my Zotero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;customising-the-storage-place-of-files&#34;&gt;Customising the storage place of files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a folder on my desktop called &lt;code&gt;papers&lt;/code&gt; in which I store all my, well, papers.
I suggest you do something similar &amp;mdash; it is &lt;strong&gt;easy to back up&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;easy to find&lt;/strong&gt; and its &lt;strong&gt;contents are easily searchable&lt;/strong&gt;, which is what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;linking-the-data-to-a-file&#34;&gt;Linking the data to a file&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Zotero you can link a bibliographical record to a file, in two ways.
Either you reimport the file into Zotero, allowing Zotero to make a copy and store it somewhere in its directory where it is not easy to find.
The other option is to link to the file.
And since we made a folder with all our files, we know exactly where it is and which file we should link to.
Then, as you click, it is super easy to find the paper (still assuming you had access and have a local copy of it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;renaming-the-file-after-metadata&#34;&gt;Renaming the file after metadata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after you linked to the file within Zotero, you can go right click on the file itself (within Zotero), and rename the file after the metadata, i.e. the bibliographical record you imported/wrote/adapted.
This makes finding data even easier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next video basically outlines this approach (although he doesn&amp;rsquo;t store them in a separate location. Listen to me and not to him!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aDvAPLZwCY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; encrypted-media&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;juris-m&#34;&gt;Juris-M&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, actually these days I don&amp;rsquo;t use Zotero itself anymore, but instead tend to use Juris-M.
Why is that?
Juris-M is able to &lt;a href=&#34;https://our.law.nagoya-u.ac.jp/howto/jurism-set-multilingual.webm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;handle multilingual support&lt;/a&gt; in bibliographical records and since I am dealing with Chinese papers and the occasional Japanese one, it is a very handy feature, that many people can&amp;rsquo;t believe hasn&amp;rsquo;t been integrated into Zotero itself yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, all the good things of Zotero still exist in Juris-M:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;magic stick input with ISBN / DOI numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the whole archiving process I briefly outlined above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plug-ins into Word or .odt files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;online sync to your account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/styles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;superlarge repository of citation styles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that is the way to handle files. But now, what do I do after I have gotten the bibliographical record and a soft/hard copy of the paper?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;taking-notes&#34;&gt;Taking notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am assuming you are using some kind of note-taking strategy to deal with research.
For classes I tend to have a mix of written notes and digital ones, but for research I pretty much put everything in a digital note-taking programme.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evernote.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt; since a few years, because of their (back then) really good free plan &amp;mdash; recently they&amp;rsquo;ve limited the free integration on different devices to a whopping maximum of two.
But if you do want to use if for free, I would suggest computer and phone, because Evernote has a nice phone camera integration, as well as the ever-so-useful webclipper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are alternatives out there, such as MS&amp;rsquo;s  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.onenote.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OneNote&lt;/a&gt; or the more recent hashtag-friendly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bear-writer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; etc.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably most beneficial to just stick with one, and since I settled on Evernote a few years ago, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to stay there.
However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I am completely in love with it: for instance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;its continued lack&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/99861-native-markdown-support/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;markdown integration is very annoying&lt;/a&gt;, because that is a very efficient way of taking notes.
But it must be said, Evernote is a behemoth, and can probably handle virtually all of your note-taking qualms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let us go back to our topic.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say, you have your paper, did all the bibliographical stuff correctly.
Now what?
Use Zotero to make a bibliographical reference and put it in the title of your Evernote note. It&amp;rsquo;s best to make some kind of folder to collect all research notes &amp;mdash; mine is called &lt;code&gt;Annotated Bibliography&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you are gonna want to repeat the same line as the first line of the note itself. This is because sometimes you have to shorten the title a little bit, for instance when it is too long because it is a book chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I always put the date I read it, in the order of year-month-day: &lt;code&gt;Read: YYYYMMDD&lt;/code&gt;. This is because if you later revisite the note, Evernote might update the record to the new date you did some changes on.
So I generally end up with a header that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018/Evernote_header.png&#34; alt=&#34;PLN 2017&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beneath that line (&lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;) I can start my note itself: what I think are important points, or things I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with.
Usually I will also write some judgment right below the &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; information, saying if I liked the paper or not.
The trick is to allow future me to able to recall the big message of the paper without having to plough through it completely again.
However, that also depends on how well you process it the first time.
Luckily, note-taking software usually allows for good searching capabilities, to help you find previous notes, and also relate notes you didn&amp;rsquo;t know where dealing with similar things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the option to tag them, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really make use of this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is basically it, but then quantified over many papers. I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember when I exactly started doing it as follows, but I currently have 233 notes in Evernote and apparently 889 items in Zotero.
This reflects my evolution from 2014 or 2015 onwards: going from paper to Zotero to more digital notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this has been useful to you (as it was for me &amp;mdash; spelling out my process and seeing how it evolved from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thomasvanhoey.com/post/icons-we-live-by/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;last year&amp;rsquo;s workflow&lt;/a&gt;).
In the next update of this series (&lt;em&gt;Academic Workflow&lt;/em&gt;) I am going to discuss R and Rmarkdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk a bit about research. I know, I don&amp;rsquo;t often do that on this blog â some of you might even have the impression that this is only a travel blog or something similar, but in fact travel is very peripheral to my life, although I like to flood my social media accounts with nice pictures of said travels whenever possible.
So, this is &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; direction I want to take this blog to.
I hope you will still like it, and if not, at least I will have gotten out of it what I wanted, namely, to describe a bit how my research process generally works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-pln&#34;&gt;The PLN&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to figure that out, I first want to talk about the theory of the &lt;strong&gt;Personal Learning Network&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Personal Learning Environment&lt;/strong&gt;.
As explained by Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A personal learning network is an &lt;em&gt;informal&lt;/em&gt; learning network that consists of the &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; a learner interacts with and derives knowledge from in a personal learning environment.
In a PLN, a person makes a connection with another person with the specific intent that some type of learning will occur because of that connection.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most recent years it pops up more and more in articles that deal with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;educational techonology&lt;/a&gt;.
And I first ran into it when I was secretly browsing the course materials of &amp;lsquo;Encyclopaedia of Japanology&amp;rsquo; taught at the University of Leuven&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:The-parallel-Enc&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:The-parallel-Enc&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, taught by Hans Coppens.
If you want a librarian&amp;rsquo;s view on what a PLN (Personal Learning Network) is or can be, I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.academia.edu/22559676/Personal_Learning_Network_A_powerful_Tool_for_Professional_Development&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Faisal&amp;rsquo;s paper&lt;/a&gt; very useful.
However, for me it can be loosely characaterized as a representation of all the different media you consume (input) and produce (output) in your day-to-day life.
Since our current life is largely dominated by a certain &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; or at least &lt;em&gt;reinforcement&lt;/em&gt; to be interconnected&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:I-know-some-peop&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:I-know-some-peop&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I have decided to use the icons of the apps I use most in my daily life to chart what my PLN looks like.
However, I should say, that before we can dive into the current state of affairs, we must first go back to about a year ago, let us say May 2017.
Get set? Ready? Go!&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Yes-the-careful&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Yes-the-careful&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-pln-anno-may-2017&#34;&gt;My PLN anno May 2017&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018/PLN_2017.png&#34; alt=&#34;PLN 2017&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this picture is a pretty good estimate of what &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; personal learning network looked like about a year ago.
Let us go over this network following the colours of the rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;red-output&#34;&gt;Red: output&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first start with the output part, because I am pretty proud of that.
This workflow has been a few years in the making, but about a year ago, I already had a pretty good flow I felt: for school (university) work, I would typically first access &lt;strong&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;library websites&lt;/strong&gt; or other &lt;strong&gt;databases&lt;/strong&gt;, or more general &lt;strong&gt;books or articles&lt;/strong&gt;.
The records returned I would then store in a reference manager, such as &lt;strong&gt;Zotero&lt;/strong&gt;, and in a note taking app, such as &lt;strong&gt;Evernote&lt;/strong&gt;.
I plan to do an overview of this &amp;ldquo;gathering&amp;rdquo; phase of research in a future blog post, as it is quite crucial to the way I do things â it is pretty customized, but I believe it is a very adoptable approach.
Then, from Evernote (and the preceding books, articles etc.) I would start to write my papers, of course interacting with new data in other &lt;strong&gt;databases&lt;/strong&gt;, or annotation tools such as &lt;strong&gt;Markus&lt;/strong&gt; or corpora such as &lt;strong&gt;Sketch Engine&lt;/strong&gt;.
Then, as a word processor, I would â as I suppose most of my peers would â use &lt;strong&gt;MS Office&lt;/strong&gt; programs such as &lt;strong&gt;Word&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Powerpoint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:My-favourite-dra&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:My-favourite-dra&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Excel&lt;/strong&gt;.
It must be said that by last year Excel has been slowly replaced by open source variants such as &lt;strong&gt;LibreOffice&amp;rsquo;s Calc&lt;/strong&gt;, for the simple reason that the Windows suite tends to use a lot of hidden code that (can) severely mixes up the data when you import it into &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;.
So, for output formats, &lt;strong&gt;posters&lt;/strong&gt; would usually come from Powerpoint; and &lt;strong&gt;documents&lt;/strong&gt; from Word (in &lt;strong&gt;PDF&lt;/strong&gt;) format.
These I would then store locally, in cloud formats such as &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as on a regular back-up hard drive.
Other dissimination includes of course, &lt;strong&gt;book chapters&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;(future)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt; articles, but also such services as &lt;strong&gt;Academia.edu&lt;/strong&gt;.
The status of the last one is still not entirely clear, though: it is for profit, but it also has a very low threshold and the publishers are afraid of it because they see their ginormous profits trimmed down &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;orange-daily-reference&#34;&gt;Orange: daily reference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part is pretty easy, it includes a daily dictionary app for Chinese called &lt;strong&gt;Pleco&lt;/strong&gt;, which is free and the best on the market as far as I know.
&lt;strong&gt;Message to future sponsors: Should you be in the dictionary app business for Chinese, please send me a free sample and I will review it for you.&lt;/strong&gt;
Online, however, I like to consult the &lt;strong&gt;Handian&lt;/strong&gt; æ¼¢å¸, also known as &lt;strong&gt;zdic.net&lt;/strong&gt;. Similarly, &lt;strong&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt; is probably everybody&amp;rsquo;s go-to site (well, not the Chinese who can always &amp;lsquo;Give &lt;strong&gt;Baidu&lt;/strong&gt; a try&amp;rsquo; ãç¾åº¦ä¸ä¸ã).
I don&amp;rsquo;t think this category needs much explaining, but do let me know if you want to know more about a particular tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;yellow-blog&#34;&gt;Yellow: blog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what you are looking at right now.
I generally use &lt;strong&gt;FlickR&lt;/strong&gt; to store my picture, to embed into a &lt;strong&gt;Wordpress&lt;/strong&gt;-driven website.
In the very beginning of my &amp;lsquo;blog&amp;rsquo;-life, I was at &lt;strong&gt;Blogger&lt;/strong&gt;, but then I moved to Wordpress - still available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://sinologica.wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;sinologica.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;, should you be in a nostalgic mood and want to read my stories of China (in Dutch).
Later on, I used the Wordpress software to self-host, and now that also has changed (see next post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;green-media-consumption&#34;&gt;Green: media consumption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For music and films, I generally turn towards &lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;, or apps that can help me play media, such as &lt;strong&gt;VLC&lt;/strong&gt;.
In written media, I tend to turn to my RSS feed, using &lt;strong&gt;Feedly&lt;/strong&gt; - just a collection of blogs I think are interesting, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://tuppublog.wordpress.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the one on Akkadian history run&lt;/a&gt; by my Assyriologist friend from Leuven, CÃ©line Debourse.
Other news media I peruse include a Belgian newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;De Morgen&lt;/strong&gt; (although I sometimes follow the rabbit hole to less-reputable &lt;strong&gt;Het Laatste News&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;the latest news&amp;rdquo;).
Then, of course, we cannot deny the &lt;em&gt;social&lt;/em&gt; aspect of news these days - which I think is where this whole PLN analysis shows its value:
&lt;strong&gt;Reddit&lt;/strong&gt; (for Taiwanese readers: ãéå°ç£äººçPTTã) is an online forum where literally everything can be discussed.
&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Instagram&lt;/strong&gt; are very informative as well, although their fun and thus slightly addictive nature must not be denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;blue-social-media&#34;&gt;Blue: social media&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the previously mentioned social media &amp;lsquo;media channels&amp;rsquo;, there are apps to stay in contact with people at home and friends.
As I am in the position of having to deal with Europe, China and Taiwan, I have become subject to installing three different apps, depending on the dominant one in the region: &lt;strong&gt;Line&lt;/strong&gt; for Taiwan, &lt;strong&gt;WeChat&lt;/strong&gt; for China, and &lt;strong&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/strong&gt; for Europe.
And, as my good friend Guillermo aptly remarked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ay TomÃ¡s, they are all fucking green!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. They are. And I always press on the wrong one&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other apps in this category include the professional network site &lt;strong&gt;LinkedIN&lt;/strong&gt;.
I get a lot of &amp;lsquo;friend&amp;rsquo; requests on this one, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really use it to its fullest potential, although I like to think that is because academia &amp;lsquo;works differently&amp;rsquo;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the future thinks about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, almost lastly, there are the social movie check site &lt;strong&gt;iCheck Movies&lt;/strong&gt; and the social book reading site &lt;strong&gt;Goodreads&lt;/strong&gt;, which I occassionally add the things I read.
Note that I have to read many books for my PhD, and I already catalogue them in Zotero and Evernote, so I don&amp;rsquo;t always update these accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have &lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;, where I very sporadically unleash a tweet upon the world.
I hope you catch them when I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;indigo-mail-and-planner&#34;&gt;Indigo: mail and planner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these I am mostly reliant on &lt;strong&gt;Outlook.com&lt;/strong&gt; and such Google products as &lt;strong&gt;Gmail&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/strong&gt; (called Agenda in Dutch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;violet-some-other-apps&#34;&gt;Violet: some other apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For learning words in a language, I like to rely on &lt;strong&gt;Anki&lt;/strong&gt;, since it has helped me &amp;lsquo;cram&amp;rsquo; in the past.
I need &lt;strong&gt;Google Maps&lt;/strong&gt; in my daily life, or I will lose my way and disappear.
And to track my footsteps, I like to use &lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s MiFit&lt;/strong&gt;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about that biodata that China then would acquire of me, but my own curiosity to monitor myself is too great.
Besides, at this point, the data will be given to another party anyhow&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rainbow-putting-it-all-togehter&#34;&gt;Rainbow: putting it all togehter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yes, that was the state of affairs about a year ago.
As you can see, there are different &amp;lsquo;categories&amp;rsquo; in my life that are dominated by different apps, and I am sure that for most of my readers, it must be very similar, whether you are a linguistics student or otherwise engaged with the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next update I will go over what has changed, but it mostly concerns the whole research output section.
In the meantime, &lt;strong&gt;I hope you can think a bit about which apps influence you in your daily life.&lt;/strong&gt;
And &lt;strong&gt;I hope that you even chart your PLN, so we can compare!&lt;/strong&gt;
Or &lt;strong&gt;if you have any lifehacks or academic hacks, please do let me know!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace out!
And Happy Easter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:The-parallel-Enc&#34;&gt;The parallel &amp;lsquo;Encyclopaedia of Sinology&amp;rsquo; class I had to take was a bit more traditional in its outlook. In itself this was not a bad thing, but I wished there had been a bit more attention to digital media than there was back then. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:The-parallel-Enc&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:I-know-some-peop&#34;&gt;I know some people actively try to resist this trend, and in some way I respect it, but for me it is not entirely possible. People I am referring to are my dear fellow student Ruei-Liang, who is a hardcore advocate of paper; or one of my favourite writers on the subject of (academic) productivity, &lt;a href=&#34;http://calnewport.com/blog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:I-know-some-peop&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:Yes-the-careful&#34;&gt;Yes, the careful reader will have noticed that this is not the canonical order of these sentences. However, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMqL1iWfku4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Crayon Pop&lt;/a&gt; girls seem not to care. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:Yes-the-careful&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:My-favourite-dra&#34;&gt;My favourite drawing tool. &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:My-favourite-dra&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
